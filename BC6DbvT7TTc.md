Okay, so this is one question Friday. You guys submitted questions. This one, the audio was actually bad, so we're not going to play it. I'm just going to read the question for you guys. So the first question is, Sam, will Milk Road ever be bigger than the hustle? So for those who don't know the hustle, there's a lot of people listening, I think we actually don't know what that is. The hustle used to be the publisher of this podcast. It was a daily email, not as 2.5 million people or 2 million people, I think, and we sold it to HubSpot, and it was a pretty good thing.

Sean now has this thing called the Milk Road, which is very similar to what that business was, but a totally different niche. And he could talk about how big it is if he wants to, but it's got really big like in six months. And I actually, the reason why I wanted to answer this question, and I'll let you do a lot of the talking, but I'll go for really quick. I actually think I was thinking about this and my friend Jason, Jason Yano Witts, who's actually kind of a competitor to you. He runs BlackWorks. He lives in, or I live in the building, I'm in Brooklyn right now for four months, and he lives in the same building and we've become friends.

And he told me, he's like, I think media is one of the best businesses to scale to a hundred million dollars in revenue, but also like the hardest thing to then get to a billion in revenue. And I was like, well, that's interesting. Why? And he goes, well, because it's just such a straightforward methodology for four or five years or six, seven years to get like a hundred million. You just like pick a niche, you build this audience. If you can do it by email and then you sell some type of research or some type of subscription and you're making money through advertising and then you host a conference and you just do the same thing, but bigger and more often over and over and over again for like eight years.

So because of that, I sold a new year for, I think if Sean sticks with it, if Sean and Ben stick with it and decide to make it big, I think that it could definitely be make many, many, many tens of millions or even a hundred million dollars a year in revenue. If they A, have the patience, B, the focus and C, more importantly, the desire to make it like that. So yes, I think it's so super straightforward to build this business. That doesn't mean it's easy, but it's simple. Right. I think you nailed it.

I think that's exactly on point. And I am not surprised you nailed it because this is something you probably think about a lot. This was the industry and the product category you lived and breathed every day. So I think you kind of nailed it. Let's actually, I don't have much to add on that. Let's add. There was another question we were debating. I think it's Wait, I'll wrap up this one question, which is there's maybe a world, more likely a world where you actually sell it for many tens of millions of dollars like I did.

And that will be like an amazing outcome. So yeah, this business definitely is. Yeah. Our software is the worst. Have you heard of HubSpot? See, most CRMs are a cobbled together mess, but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous. I think I love our new CRM. Our software is the best HubSpot. Grow better. Yeah, my intention is like, you know, that's that's not a decision we have to make up front. It's more like, how do I want this to go? It's like, well, I want to have a small team that I like in this niche that I really like.

And I want to put out great content and build I want to build a flywheel. That's my most important thing right now is like, right now is the hardest part crank at the flywheel at the beginning. But I want to build a flywheel, which is that every time we push send, you know, the audience gets more trust, more loyalty. We get every new subscriber we come bring in brings in more friends. And so I'm just trying to build these like this asset and then we'll see now, you know, crypto, I think is a more valuable niche than the one you were in.

But I think you were earlier into this game and figured things out before the game is harder now to play because there's way more competition and the playbook is there's more success cases. So a lot of people copy like you guys, they copy Morning Brew, they copy you guys because when you guys are doing it, there wasn't a ton of like popular success stories where people look at that blueprint and say, okay, I want to do this for me. It was easy. It was like, dude, sounds like good buddy. I know that blueprint. And I am really interested this niche.

Let me use that blueprint. And there's a lot of people that try that. Not everybody's going to succeed for sure, but like the prices were lower, the cost of talent was lower, the number of competitors were lower back then. So I think I'm in a better niche than you were in. But I think you were earlier. And then there's the question of, will I have the patience and talent that you had to build this thing up? Well, I think you have the talent. You have the talent. It's just, it's really just, is that what you want? And building a business for like 10 years, I mean, to make it big, you like what I learned is like a lot of value happens in your five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, some of those later years.

One sure. That's kind of like it. That's how to boot. If you're talking about bootstrapping, it takes a while to like figure out an industry. But anyway, I actually think that I agree with you. Your niche is more valuable. I think both of our niches were big enough though, where it's like, yeah, I mean, this could, this could be a very large business. It's just like, do you want to do that for eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 years, whatever. So will the milk road be bigger than the hustle? It absolutely can. It absolutely can. Right.

So that's my answer to that question. All right. Let's do this other one real quick. So it says, you guys have the money, experience, energy and wisdom to build something legit and big. But you've chosen relatively safe things like Sam's working on short turn rental Airbnb's and Sean started a newsletter company. Why? Totally fair question. Good question, I think. What's your reaction to that? My reaction is, A, I do things that are fun. And so like maybe fun's not the best word, but like give me energy. And B, I think that when you start something like, I'm not really always trying to start something that innovative.

I'm just trying to like do cool stuff really well and it's going to end up being probably pretty big. And also like, dude, starting a new thing, even particularly if it's like you're creating a market like Uber or something like that, you kind of have to dedicate your life to it. And there's other businesses that you could actually have a little bit more fun and a little bit more balance and probably a better result. You know what I mean? Yeah. My answer is very similar, which is lifestyle. Right? Like I've said this before, starting a startup that's like one of the big, you know, we're going to create, you know, we're going to send rockets to Mars type of startups that Elon Musk's, the Twitters, the YouTubes, the Facebook's of the world, the Ubers.

These are that's the vocation. Business. Yeah. It's it is your life and it is going to dominate a decade of your life, win or lose. And like, it's going to come with a certain stress level and a certain time commitment that is pretty much required to do it. And so I thought of it like the last two businesses I started were, and I, by the way, I did that. All of my twenties were pursuing a game like that. And then we sold when I was 30 or 31. And then my 30s so far have been starting a family.

So I had two kids, 34 years old. I just turned 34. And I was like, what? And I was, you know, I'm like, okay, well, what do I want to do with my like time in my life right now? And I was like, well, I don't know. I got really fat while I was starting those companies. Like I'd like to be healthy and in great shape. That became like a priority for me. It's like, I want to have a kid. I had two kids that obviously becomes like a top priority. And then it's like, well, I want to, you know, enjoy myself.

And like, I do like to do business, but is there a version of business that's the, what's the version of business that's the most fun? If I was optimizing for fun and not for ambition, what would fun lead me to go do? And, and so I found a mix of things like I consider this a season right now, like maybe it's a seven year season. And it's when my kids are little babies that I'm going to like do things that I'm like, I could do at home. Like the first one is I started an ecommerce business.

And that was something I could do pretty easily. It was a totally different type of challenge. And it's not going to be a billion dollar business. That's not the goal. The goal is for every quarter to get a fat check of, you know, a million dollars of profit every three months from that business. That would be sweet. And then eventually, you know, sell that thing for, I don't know, $80 million or something like that. That would be a good outcome for that business. And then the newsletter, the Moke Road was like, well, I'm just super curious about crypto.

What, like, why don't I just follow my curiosity? Like if I want to be learning about the stuff, let me just make a business the byproduct of me being curious. And that kind of became my mindset was, let the business be the byproduct of the factory. The factory is based on fun and curiosity. And then the money comes as the exhaust out the chimney. And so that's what I did. Like the podcast was the fun, curious thing to go do, the thing I just enjoy doing for fun. And it generates some money, but also, you know, let's say starting my fund off of the back of the podcast, like to invest, that became a business model byproduct of what I was already doing anyways, which was studying different niches in industries and businesses and getting to know those founders and like investing became a byproduct of that.

Good. Good. My short answer is I'm not going for the most ambitious thing. I think in general, there's a trap there because all the movies and and articles you read will be glorifying the hero winners of that Olympic Games, of the brutal Olympic sport of building billion dollar companies. And my goal is not to like have, you know, like have a billion dollars. I want to have a billion billion billion dollar lifestyle. And like a billionaire lifestyle has a bunch of time and like has it can spend with their family and I like to I work out in the middle of the day with my trainer at my house.

Like that's those things give me incredible amount of joy. And so I would not want to start a business that overrides or interrupts that I want to start a business that has a juicy prize but fits in that lifestyle. So that became my focus. I'm going to do that for a season of like maybe seven years and then I'll reassess and see like, you know, what comes after that? Fucking a good answer. Ben, what do you think? We good? And hey, this is producer Ben just as Sean mentioned. I just wanted to come here on the end to let you know how you can have your question featured on my first million.

And that is by going to MFM pod.com and clicking on the microphone in the lower right hand corner and you can record an audio message. And obviously the one on this episode was a little bit low quality. So we weren't able to play it most of the time. We'll play your audio. So yeah, go leave us a question.
