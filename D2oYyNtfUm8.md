I think this is one of the multi billion dollar trends that like you could be on right now and I don't say that for hyperbole like literally this is the window the tech is just now finally good enough it's not quite there but you need to start now and you could disrupt all of these marketplaces All right, I went out with uh Hassan last night for dinner. Can I tell you about it really quick? Do it it was awesome. So you're he like admires you a lot. Do you know that? I admire him a lot.

So uh you pronounce his name minhash or minhash right with the name? I think I think his name is actually pronounced Hassan minhash and everybody calls him Hassan minhash because it sounds awesome and it's like Nicki Minaj. Nicki Minaj. And so you know whatever I don't know what the I don't know how how strict he is on that. Well we so basically the story of this is Sean interviewed him uh last year I thought I saw him on the street and I ran up and like went and said hey and it actually wasn't him and I looked like an idiot and I tweeted about it and he texts me I guess he got my number from you and he texts me and we went and hung out so this guy is like this you know pretty big deal comedian he is so smart he's so much smarter than I am and that's what I learned that in number two I was so intimidated to be around him because I didn't know if like if I was like can I make him laugh if I can make him laugh I'm like this is a weird and I really didn't I didn't make him laugh I failed I did not I cannot make him laugh and he like showed me these books that he's reading and I wanted to google like I wanted to tweet this out but I was too embarrassed so maybe you could tell me but I like like googled like books on how to be funny because after I hung out after I hung out with him I was like dude this guy's got me in a trance he could tell me about anything he's so funny and good at storytelling like I'm so into it and I was like I want to figure out how to be funny and I went on Amazon and I googled like how to be funny or like how to be clever and do you remember years ago when I wrote that article about this guy who games the Amazon Kindle system to rank really high and it's like shit books but you like buys reviews dude it's like six of the top ten on page one we're all him it's all this guy I know the author I know the guy's safe so it's all bullshit what is there are there good books that I can read you think on how to be funny or how to be clever like I felt like such a nerd like I was going to tweet this out but I'm gonna look like the biggest virgin on earth just like how do I like be clever in a conversation yeah I don't know dude that I feel like this is a it's like a it's like a skill that's only passed down like you know by hand and you can it's only like trial by fire like you have to like learn this when you're 12 and get good at like busting people's balls and like saying the funny thing in class like Theo Vaughn has this like hilarious I know you like the O2 so here's this hilarious story he tells he goes dude I was in my like freshman I remember the first time I realized I was funny as a comedian he's like I was a freshman year at college and I was going to school in Louisiana or whatever he's like and my professor said to our class he was like you know look to your left look to your right you know statistics will say that you know one one of the one of the three of you one out of every three people are going to end up being like a child whatever molester or something like that he goes and I stood up and I just go not it he's like that was the moment and first of all this is a hilarious story and secondly I think there's some truth to like you have these little moments where you get rewarded for being funny early on in life and you're like ooh more that more of that all right how do I get more that laugh no I want more of that and then you just keep doing it talents real but I think it's a I think just like anything like you know some people will never be able to dunk but you definitely can improve you can learn how to dribble better than before for sure like there's got to be a skill there there's definitely a skill here you know I think like the best are definitely just born better but I can be good I can be good at least there's a YouTube video that you should watch so I've gone down this rabbit hole probably also after I met and I was like shit he would tell me a story on the pod where he'd be talking and I'm so into the story I'm like you know what is it eating out the palm of his hand and then he would ask me a question mid story and I just I'm like nodding like I'm still listening like it's a TV show and then I didn't realize that he said something to me like he said he was telling some stories like everybody's got that kid growing up like you had that kid who who was it for you and I was so enthralled by the story that I was just like yes and I realized that it was like oh he asked me for a name and then I thought about who that would be because I said now it said yes that there is a kid and he's like who was it and I was like I can't remember any names growing up I'm so into you that I've like forgotten who I am and my entire past and so you know that was what was happening when he was telling stories but I asked him afterwards and I think he gave me a YouTube video that was fun that he's like this is kind of interesting so it's called Mark Normand How to Write a Joke and I think it's like an hour long podcast so it's the thing is called Writing a Joke with Mark Normand and Mark Normand is a good joke writer he's a funny comedian yeah he's great and this one hour thing he like kind of breaks down some of the like mechanics of what makes something funny and it's not like follow this these three easy steps and you too can be funny but it is like oh okay I could see how this like if I constantly if I consistently practice these mechanics I can take something that's like not so funny and make it funnier repeatedly and then like from there there's more there's storytelling and there's setups and there's like tagging jokes and there's other like things that you got to learn obviously if you want to do this well but I think that video is pretty good I'll watch that there's these guys who have this YouTube channel called Charisma on Command and it's a beautiful name they've been doing it forever have you seen these guys yeah I remember for like maybe five seven years ago I was yeah and it's yeah and they're cool they're it could be a little lame because it's a it's a little bit more and like nerdy guys how to meet women which is cool and fine whatever but like you know I was not trying to I was dating my wife at the time so it's like well I just want to learn how to be like more charismatic and I remember their name and they like taught a course on it and like they had all this stuff it's like that's a beautiful name Charisma on Command I'll watch that Mark Norman joke but anyway hung out with this dude last night it was dope he paid for dinner so good first date uh it was awesome did you try to pay did you do the thing no no for sure a lot me but I you know it's funny it's when I go to he like like this we went to Gramercy Tavern and he likes that place which is I guess is like a fancy or kind of fancy place and I was like dude you come here a lot he goes yeah I love it I go I'm not even gonna look at a menu whatever you want to order for me just you just do it all and that's that's how I love I love going to restaurants like that I do that all the time I'm like I don't care I eat meat and vegetables get whatever so I was the best is then after they order then you complain uh you gotta do that too that's the the true d bag move by the way you don't want to think people liked from the last pod or maybe a couple pods ago I got a bunch of dms about this they were like dude I love the homie move that you said I was like I didn't remember what he's talking about he's like he's like remember the homie move that's like one of the top 10 things you've shared on the pod which was you were like dude guess how many blah blah blah and like when you say that obviously it's something impressive but I kind of guessed low so that you can have your your punchline where you're like a hundred million and I'm like oh I only said 10 because I kind of knew it's more than 10 but let me give you this moment people love that uh that's hilarious yeah I saw the comments people did dig that on YouTube right right um so I made a little vow to myself to bring more specific ideas and stories uh to the pod because I personally love the free flowing just like whatever wherever our conversation goes it goes but I want to make sure that you know we have the entree not just top us it's not just the appetizers I want to have the entree so let's jump into a couple ideas I got a few too all right I got one big one I'm gonna go one and then you go one all right so we've talked about this a little bit in the past Dolly and like how much AI is advancing and I don't know if it's just like my TikTok feed keeps feeding me these but every day I see a new incredible thing that AI can do you have to explain what all is blown me away what's that you have to explain what Dolly is Oh Dolly is a program it's a artificial intelligence program um Dolly too I think is the current name of it that basically you just type in any word and it generates images on that so you could be like Sam Parr you know um fishing and it will just generate images that like look like they're either hand drawn or like a stock photo that are Sam Parr fishing even though no such image exists let's say it will create the image so it like flips the whole idea of like creating art or taking photos or or painting something and it kind of like flips it on its heads like no computers and robots can now do that almost as good if not in some cases better than what would be you know the real thing or humans human stuff and so you see that you see deep fakes like there's videos where you'll see the Mona Lisa and then they're like watch this and they push a button and also the Mona Lisa starts turning her head and she starts rapping like you know notorious b.i.g

and it looks like the mouth is like in sync with the lyrics and the thing looks real it's like yeah they just took it they can take an image and they could turn it into a video using a.i like a.i can basically say oh if I have this image I know where the eyes and those and lips are I have been trained on what talking looks like what singing looks like what looking around and acting natural looks like and I can turn any image into that and it's really good it's really good they could take Barack Obama and they can make him like this happened now with the Ukraine thing they took the the Russian president like and the way that people can photoshop an image to make it look real you could take Barack Obama and you can make it sound and look like he is saying something you know completely racist or whatever so yeah I think oh man I can't trust videos well I heard a podcast about that particular one I think someone made one of these things to show how amazing it is and then they also showed but here's a downfall and they made Obama I think he said the n word or something like crazy like not cool and they're like he said that and that amazing obviously he didn't but like it seems exactly like he said it this is where it's gonna it's gonna get dangerous totally and let me so so just keep going to some random examples so there's another one where you you can draw like a very basic smiley face on on your iPad on this app called procreate and then you can it's basically just like eyes nose mouth and you're just like pencil drawing it then you change the brush to the AI paintbrush and you just kind of like shade in like you know like when a kid would like I saw the end a shape and it like colors in as if you like painted this in fine detail with the shadows and the colors that and all you're doing is literally just moving your hand like a fool and it's like it knows already what like high quality art looks like and it just turns your crappy art into high quality art um it's amazing and so every day there's all these little amazing magic tricks and they're not like foolproof yet but the demo is getting ridiculously impressive and so I used it to come up with a logo for a business I'm thinking about starting I use it to come up with a logo and it was awesome oh I do that all the time yeah if you just google AI logo generator or brand generator there's like four websites that you can use and you just say like uh I you know it's a legal it's a legal startup uh the mood is serious but still sophisticated go and it'll spit out like an infinite number of logo variations that you could then and they could be like cool print this on business cards that's like how they make money is like print this on a business card or like give me the high quality photo you actually use it right like I used it I used it yeah normally what I do is I go to 99 designs and I have like you 99 designs is amazing because you can get like 30 graphic designers to like make up a landing page and you'd be like I like details from number one number eight number 14 and then someone combines all of them and they give me the one that I want whereas when you work with just one designer you got to like a kind of be nice to them and be like no this this is you know this is okay but can you kind of change it like this instead I could be like no this sucks do this but also be you can see all different combinations and with Dolly I'm excited to use it in that way and so let me give you like a couple ideas that I've had based off of what I've seen so here's what I I think these can be very big ideas now the problem with these I'll tell the problem also is that I think it's so easy to do that you're gonna have a bunch of competition so you know you have to find a way to be defensive but here okay here we go four ideas that you can do with AI like right now okay so number one is which one I want to start with okay so number one is going to be a fake speech so I'm investing in this company called Unreal Speech I don't know if you've heard this but check this out this guy sends me deep fake audio of somebody of Gary V and Jordan Peterson reading the milkroads I'm gonna just play one of these I think you can hear it let me just the newsletter that brings you so much entertainment news and laughs it should be illegal yeah no hypothetically speaking of course here's what's happening around crypto dude it sounds all right so that's like Jordan Peterson it's just like Jordan Peterson here's Gary V the newsletter that brings you so much entertainment news and laughs it should be illegal yeah no hypothetically speaking of course you can see it messes up sometimes what's happening around crypto the new stablecoin on the block so so you that's amazing that is so good this is off like that available very little this very little training data and literally just like takes my thing and you could see the the places where my my written stuff is like kind of like casual I'm like you know blah blah blah it like it doesn't do that part very well but the other parts it does like pretty dang well for a very small amount of training unreal speech is it available to everyone yeah so well it's like it's like brand new so and so he was like hey yeah Sean you want to never do an ad read again he's like you know you have hundreds of hours of audio of you and Sam's voice that's on the podcast like all you need to do is just say the word and I can make it so that you'll never have to do an ad read again did I can make you I can make it so that the milk road it'll auto add a companion audio like if somebody wants to listen to the newsletter on the go like it'll do it in your voice like I can just do that now and I was like wow this is incredible he's like yeah and the and the way we're doing it is cheaper faster and like more accurate than like the the kind of the other models that are out there on like Amazon or whatever so it's like you know dramatically cheaper to do because this is a little bit expensive whenever you do this because it's like machine learning but the cost just keeps falling every year and then there's techniques to make it even smaller and so think about this like a language translation so for example there's a world where we do this podcast and unreal speech could translate this into another language in our voices with our tones but just speaking another language and so now all of a sudden our podcast is in you know it is being you know done in Spanish and in French and all these other languages and so we could grow without having to actually do extra work ourselves damn dude that's crazy all ad reads stuff like that so I think that's a great business there's also um yeah there's there's other kind of like use cases for it but I'll leave it at that okay here's another one um student essays so I told you about that guy who made a thing called write like Sean.com

and it like I like mentioned it in my email and it like blew up and like caused him to have like a thousand dollar bill on his servers and he was like you know oh shit like you know the side project now is like a financial burden for me um but basically this guy trained AI to write like I do and it was pretty damn good and I shared an example last time but this is not like has other to do with me it's just you could take any corpus of text data in this case he just used my Twitter feed as like the corpus of text it could train it to write like that well there's one of the big things like you know I don't know if you remember growing up but like you get assigned you have to write an essay in school and you know some people would pay other people to do it for them some people would go find one online and try to plagiarize it well this is going to basically screw that whole thing up because I'm going to be able to go on there and say hey write an essay about world war two and Germany's role in it um in the sophistication of a tenth grader and it's just going to spit out a full essay or like a thousand versions of an essay and I could just pick the one I like and I could just edit it in like maybe five minutes to like get rid of any like crappy computer mess ups yeah this is wild you remember turn it in the essay will be done did you have turn it in dot com like it would help you like if you know what is that you have to submit an essay in high school it happened so I used to like uh I had this website that like would give you free essays and I would use them all the time uh you know and like most well I don't know most people do it but you know a lot of people do it some people out there will think this is okay a person us and a person did it and it was awesome and I you like rewrite it a little bit but then they came up with turn it in dot com which ended up becoming like a huge company and sold for billions of dollars I believe where you would turn in your paper essay but then you also had to submit a an electronic copy and it did a pretty good job of finding out if it was plagiarized frankly I have no idea how it did it and I don't actually think it's that sophisticated of technology but they just sold the schools and they like trusted that it was legitimate because like if you just google a phrase in quotations you could see like where you know what I mean it's like not like that sophisticated of a of a thing but like it would alert teachers like okay like 98% of this is copied from somewhere else right but yeah the teacher doesn't want to like google the teacher doesn't want to google everybody's thing so yeah that makes that makes total sense and that's that's exactly the case I think you're gonna have the creation of stuff of content on the AI auto generated content and then you're gonna have the fact checking side to detection businesses also both are gonna boom you're gonna have things that's that take a video and say is this a deep fake or is this a real video you're gonna have another one that's like is this a auto generated content or did a human write this like it's like the opposite of caption you know when you go to a website and it says prove that you're a human it's gonna basically be like prove this isn't a robot is basically what you're gonna have to do in order to trust that this person actually like did the work that's required for this so I think that that's gonna be like on both sides there's gonna be businesses I'll give you another area that's gonna get totally disrupted um print and patterns so people talk about like using AI for stock photos using AI for maybe like auto generated music that's all gonna happen too but here's what I think is like more more low key like when when Patrick came on he was talking about quilt businesses so there's a huge market of just pattern making so this is for all like clothing you know blankets you know curtains whatever basically patterns and prints are everywhere you know in apparel and fashion and so if you want to go and actually like make clothing you will often use like websites that have large libraries of patterns and prints what happens is today somebody hand draws each one of those like oh this floral pattern or this uh you know repeating pattern of you know whatever it could be like fire trucks for like you know some kid thing or whatever and then that person gets paid when you go buy that buy that pattern you buy it for what about a hundred dollars and now they get that as their like royalty stream well this is all gonna go AI in my opinion somebody can compete with these because the sites that do this they're worth hundreds of millions of dollars these marketplaces that have the creators and they have the search yeah we talked about one of them I forget what it was called I think I had gotten acquired by flower for like 400 million yeah flower something yeah some flower flower cloud or something they um uh what that's gonna turn into is I'm gonna go on there I'm gonna be like cool I'm making a you know a galaxy I want a galaxy themed repeating pattern so I'm just gonna write galaxy themed repeating pattern and it's going to generate galaxy themed patterns and then they will be able to charge one tenth of what the other sites do because there's no human involved and they'll just keep all of that revenue for themselves so they will become the supply side of the market so this is like you can build a billion dollar marketplace because you now don't have to worry about supply it's what uber's trying to do with self driving cars right it's like hey we can make these rides way cheaper and we can like you know make this whole system more efficient we just got to get to self driving and tesla's trying to do the same with the robotaxi it's like the big idea in in transportation transportation is getting rid of the driver the same thing is going to be the case with artists it's like we're going to get rid of the artists we're going to not need somebody to do the photography the videography the music the pattern making um you know the the voiceover work that's what unreal speech is right it's voiceover work um the the the essay writing the 99 designs every single one of those they're either going to have to release this and kill their own supply side or someone is going to come and do it and eat their lunch I think this is one of the multi billion dollar trends that like you could be on right now and I don't say that for hyperbole like literally this is the window the tech is just now finally good enough it's not quite there but you need to start now and you could disrupt all of these marketplaces do you ever recognize stock image models on different websites yeah there's this guy who's in the bachelor who's a stock image uh and he's like in like a bunch of like funny like whatever random like kids halloween costumes it's like there's that guy and then you see him again on this like uh hot sauce commercial like there's that guy it is just like this generic smiling black guy and um it's like they just reuse him everywhere I saw like the lady that was on the google analytics page it was two ladies and I saw one of them in public and I went up and got a picture with her and uh and like I saw her and I recognized her and then there's this other lady that was on the google analytics page she's it's like it's always it's like a lot of times the same person uh it's like a racially ambiguous woman with like curly hair it's like you know who she could be italian she could be black she could be jewish white who knows like it just represents everyone and I see this woman everywhere on all different websites I used her a couple times I love this lady and I get sick of using the same pictures though all the time so for some of my projects I've been using if you you can use dolly and you can use a couple other services and they'll give you fake people so I have a couple websites that have like testimonials and they're real testimonials but I don't want to use the people's uh face because I didn't exactly ask them for it was like an email that they like wrote me you know what I mean I didn't want to use like their face because they didn't give me permission but like it's who cares just a sentence I can use that and I'll use I google uh AI sample faces and you can get all types of faces and you could say like make this person this race make this person happy make them serious you can change it and you can make them all types of stuff and I've been using that for sample images because when we were running the hustle every once in a while we would like do it the right way where we would like use an image that was for commercial use but sometimes it would get categorized wrong and we would we'd get like a what do they call it like a uh I forget what it is yeah that's right and they say like you know you have to in multiple times we've had to pay five grand you know you just like oh fuck these guys like they're gonna cause an issue we just got paying five thousand dollars and they're gonna go away but this is we just we're gonna get uh you know we're getting screwed here but whatever we gotta do it so I've been using them for stock images so I don't have to uh worry about getting sued or get one of these cease and desist letters totally it's gonna be the case with um stock images you know like designers always use these libraries of like icons and illustrations and there's like websites like the noun project and other things like that what so what dolly did was basically they just read all of the text on the internet and then they used it to create new stuff and some people like dude that's messed up like github is doing this too github basically read all of the code that was on github they had a crawler basically index all of that learn they fed all of that that user data and they fed it into machine learning and now they have this thing called github co pilot which is I think like I don't know how much is it it's like a hundred dollars a month or something like that but it basically is like you know if you're a programmer we will this github co pilot can basically help you write your code you're like typing your code and it'll just auto fill like autocomplete the line of code so it's like oh dude that makes you know this 250 000 a year software developer more efficient and more effective and less bugs and less mistakes and less thinking it lets a less talented person sort of create these functions and write code and it's like a no brainer like github co pilot is going to generate like hundreds of millions of dollars for github like they like create a spark flip to switch it's going to be a multi billion dollar product line just because it's generating so much revenue wow and some people are mad about it because they're like dude you read my code you use my code as the training data and I get nothing from this like that's crazy you're going to basically put me out of a job by using my own data as the training data for this and that's the same thing that's going to happen what these like these websites by the way ben found spoon flower was the name of the pattern flower so all you have to do if you're doing this is like you're going to go and you're going to scrape and crawl spoon flower you're going to ingest all of the patterns with all of the tags and then you're going to basically train it train a data set so that it says okay cool the this is what a pattern with x y and z keyword looks like great now you give me that keyword again I can generate 500 new patterns from scratch and spoon flower is basically going to create it's a destroyer in that sense like it is going to the data from these from stuff that's already on the internet is what's going to destroy those those services and I say it kind of like you know in a violent way like destroy and all that stuff but it is true like these are going to be very competitive very quickly and it's going to be like the same way that the chess programs like got really good really fast and all of a sudden it's like oh yeah the human cannot be like this or the game is kind of graphic design exactly like this is going to like enslave and pillage you know it's going to go to your village it's going to kill the men it's going to marry all the women and it's going to put the children to work like that's what's going to happen with this these ai uh marketplaces that's my my prediction so ben go to this website I sent you the chat can you share this uh sam i think you've used this before too but it's a cool one for people who don't know um it's this person does not exist dot yes that's what i used and so like look at this that looks like you bed kind of it just looks like a basic white dude this guy this is like a munch on a deadline it takes a quick picture of you from your webcam and it just makes someone like you um this is a dude that this person does not exist that's a ai composite of a face so you can use this face anywhere on your website copyright free because nobody's going to be like hey dude that's me um this is like such a useful funny website and it shows you in the bottom right it'll tell you exactly how the image was created it's like it was imagined by a gan which is a type of machine learning thing or whatever um here's how it works you can use it yourself you know blah blah blah and watch this you can use it for cats and horses and chemicals it's like this this cat does not exist and you can like click a cat and it'll like ai generate a cat yeah this is amazing i usually just take screen shot of those and i use those on like different websites and so uh so yeah those are three three ideas i think i said student essay generation uh unreal voices for voiceovers um and never you know never having to basically turning your voice into a programmable asset and then patterns and prints and that's just like that's not even saying some of the obvious ones that i met other ones i mentioned like stock this is great million dollars isn't cool you know it's cool a billion dollars all right i have something for you have you heard of john steinberg is he the guy who did cheddar yeah so let's listen to this story and and i'm gonna there's a reason why i'm telling you but let me tell you the story so basically john steinberg was the c o o of buzz feet for a long time i think when he joined buzz feed it was like 20 people so he wasn't quite the co founder but he was he worked his way up to be c o o and he was like the ad sales guy he became c o o and he kind of was like pushing it hard and it was almost like a co founder of buzz feed and he's incredibly aggressive very aggressive and he started this thing years ago like eight years ago or maybe six years ago called cheddar and the whole shtick was that it was going to be a live tv station for facebook live and when he launched it we were just getting started and he like messaged me he goes have we met yet which was just an alpha like there's such an alpha way to like alpha way to like hey i forgot your name yeah he was like hey dav i was like dude it's uh it says sam right we're on facebook you know i know you're really bad with names and faces yeah what he goes have we met yet we should meet that's what he said and i go okay cool he goes i'm in san francisco what's your office i'll come tomorrow that's what he said and i was like all right yeah so i hang out with him nice nice guy incredibly aggressive basically told me that like buzzfeed was great but he wanted to sell or something or i don't know if he said this right read about it but like he wanted an exit and it didn't happen so like he was like i'm just going to build this thing and i'm going to have an exit and he's told me he was what's going to happen is i'm going to raise a little bit of money like 30 million dollars it's going to do pretty good and then a big cable company is going to buy us because it's just going to be cheaper for them to buy us and to go make one of these cable like a like a 24 hour news network on their own and they're just going to buy us for like 200 or 300 million dollars and at the time and even at the time they got bought no one watched this thing you'd go into the facebook live and like there'd be like 20 people watching it and give him point it was all on facebook and like no one watched it and i remember thinking like this guy's crazy this is not going to work no one watched this is this is nonsense this is a bad business this is a bad company and two years in he told me he goes in year two or three we're going to get acquired for a couple hundred million bucks in year three i think he sold the business for 250 million dollars 100 called his shot if you google cheddar a cable company also to a cable company to like an australian cable company that i never heard of i think they're popular in new york i think they have a thing in new york too and he sold it and he totally pulled it off and he completely disappeared he fell off the map before he was like speaking at all these conferences but he called this shot and he nailed it and i remember talking to other guys who worked in the media industry and they're like yeah he told me the exact same thing and he absolutely called this shot and this guy is so aggressive man he's a shark not in a bad way but like he just bulldozed through this he just put so much intensity and energy and he pulled it off but the reason i'm bringing this up he did it and another woman who were friends with rebecca did i asked her how she got popular on youtube she's like well i just quit my job and i like worked 50 hours a week and i had like i got up at nine and i like worked till seven and like i studied the data and i just treated it like a business and it like became popular now i make you know seven or eight figures whatever she makes a year and i'm rich and famous and whatever it worked because i was talented and i worked hard and i treated it like a job what i think is gonna happen and we this is a little circle jerky because both you and i like twitter i think that very few people take twitter seriously enough to do that you know like five or eight years ago we'd be like mr b's you're gonna like dedicate your life to youtube that's the stupidest thing ever that won't work like what are you doing this is just a hobby this is a joke now it's not it's not funny like we all know that like that's real you can become a youtuber and you know you can be like mr b's and make hundreds of millions of dollars a year you can become a tick tocker and become like some of these other famous people and do all this crazy stuff no one takes that seriously about twitter where they think like well you know if you just like quit and like take this seriously and like build a following and like write interesting stuff and i think in the next two or three years we might see like a few empires be built on top of twitter and it sounds kind of silly now because like oh it's just these like stupid like you know twitter threads of guys talking about x y and z and summarizing wikipedia and they're kind of right but i think that there's going to be someone on twitter that treats it kind of like cheddar did it's kind of like mr beast and they take it really seriously and i think there's actually a huge opening and a huge gap in the market right now where very few people are taking it seriously and it's incredibly easy to capitalize on this second right now this is one of the more interesting things i feel like you said this is i actually go i don't even got him you normally think like this i feel like this is it like a this is not your you say a lot of interesting stuff but it's you're you usually fall into i found this really interesting diamond in the rough you're amazing at that another is i see what these people are doing and let me break it down in simple terms like all they're doing is x and sometimes you're like you know this is a trend or an industry i see this is different this is like this is something something different so i like i like that you're bringing this up let's break this down so every do agree with me at first when you i think you tweeted this out and i was like i don't really understand what he's talking i didn't really understand it uh then you just explained it and it's i'm starting to come around on it i'm like oh wait he's kind of right every big social media platform has like native stars so yes if you're uh you know whatever you're the president and you go on twitter you're going to get a bunch of followers that's one thing but basically if you take every medium so podcasting you have joe rogan you have like then the people like joe rogan you have to call her daddies and you have like other tip ferris you have other people who like they become stars on that platform and they use that to build a pretty big empire you know tens of millions if not hundreds of millions that they can make off youtube obviously there's youtubers tiktok has tiktok stars people who were not famous on youtube but got famous on tiktok instagram also right there's instagram models and instagram like influencers that they were nobody and they became big on instagram multi billion dollar companies we're talking you know kardashians rihanna like these like huge things well i think they were rihanna kardashians they were big off of instagram they were big without it like instagram also and instagram had turbo charge to them but like there are other people that are you know um just instagram like instagram made them famous like dan bilzerian is a good example right like he's not famous without instagram then with instagram he becomes famous and then now he does multiple platforms right by the end everybody does multiple platforms but you kind of you're really good at the medium so like for example dan bilzerian takes photos of himself blowing up cars with hot girls like in bikinis guess what instagram is a visual like you know put one killer image on there and they're amazing at it and so uh that worked really well there you're kind of right who is that on twitter who is who is a twitter native star i don't even know what that would be like is there so who comes to mind there's a there's a few like i would say like and i'm on twitter 10 times a day like how do i not know this like you and i are like very miniature versions but we haven't really like i'm talking like sahil is a bigger version so our friend sahil bloom trung who used to work for me he is kind of like that but you know we're still talking like 500 000 followers no one has really pushed it towards like how do i get 10 or 20 million you know how do i become like how do i build a proper empire as opposed to a niche now the difference is uh basically between everything you mentioned and twitter is twitter is copy based text based whereas the other ones are visual based so i think there's one of two routes that's going to happen you figure out how to add visuals to your thing and videos don't usually do that while on twitter but pictures do or you just get really good at writing and i was like well writing's not that important but i'm like wait no i'm an idiot like you know who danielle steele or james paterson is yeah yeah of course these people have sold literally like i i believe danielle steele has sold like a hundred million plus books i don't know if you know this but in san francisco she's got like the biggest mansion in san francisco house yeah on billionaires row her house is like the big fortress yeah and then you got james paterson i bet you he's a billionaire too james paterson basically writes like 50 books a year i don't even know if he writes a lot of them if he just maxes logo on it but like you know i was thinking like well that sounds outrageous but okay uh i forget but it's maybe a one week it's like one a month it'll say like you know um what he does is like it'll be like uh written by james paterson and bill clinton and then it says like and also this other name and it's like a duo about them it's like a story written about like the white house or something like that and he like partners it's like this weird thing that he does he writes a ton he's prolific and a lot of like like real quote authors like these like artists folks are like oh that's just garbage but he's like dude i don't care i'm pumping this shit out anyway authors like definitely crush it still and the power of the written word is very powerful enough to like you know get these people to buy all these books and i still think that's possible but i i i do think that we're gonna see like an empire built on top of twitter arguably you and i have created we easily created seven figures of personal income through twitter maybe you could say even i would have to add it up maybe eight figures but a lot uh i think though that there's going to be literally billionaires created on twitter and it hasn't happened yet though wow uh yeah what's we can't call ours empires like what's a what's a very very small like a lego like a convenience store yeah like we we created like a quickie mart uh yeah we own like four burger kings you know what i mean and you're right that saw hill and trung are good examples of like like they actually try so like they like religiously write content they schedule it they research it they like publish they like try to amplify it they have calls to action at the bottom and it works and i've seen them crawl from zero to saw how's it like half a million maybe more i don't know uh dude a lot of people don't even know that trung so trung worked at the hustle he wrote the daily email we found him when he was working at like a as a financial analyst analysts not like it was all internal reports we like he signed up for twitter while he worked at my company and we all like shared each other in this like silly circle jerk circle and now he's got 600 000 followers and he's like a personality and like people know him like they talk about him and how he's funny and all this stuff and i think it's gonna happen and like when i tweeted out that event thing a thousand people signed up and i'm like oh my god like why aren't you actually see instagrant like you'll see like the logan uh the jake paul's and the logan paul they'll like say like i'm gonna be when they were starting on youtube they're like we're gonna be at this location come and they film all these crazy videos of all these people around us no one's doing that shit for twitter and i think that someone needs to just take the youtube or playbook and just deploy it here and take it full time and seriously and they could create tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of wealth and so what would you do because like i think well the guys we talked about they you know saw hill basically does like kind of like mental model intellectual like stuff or it's like oh you know either like kind of what i'll call like the generic life advice generic business advice or like um you know hey let me tell you about this phenomenon in psychology about cognitive biases and here's 30 cognitive biases you want to be aware of and like i don't know why these do so well they do incredibly well uh that's not my cup of tea but it's definitely other people's cup of tea for that here's what they need to do here's how you cross the chasm here's how you cross this threshold so basically these guys are popular on this twitter medium and twitter is a it feels like a one to one a little bit or maybe like a one to ten it's like me and my ten friends like consume this and we'll joke about it but i'm not talking to a guy on the train or i'm not like telling a family member like hey uh you know did you guys see x y and z like we're not talking about that so what they need to do is two things number one they need to meet up with like mainstream celebrity people or like mainstream people and take pictures with them and show it and it's like oh man this guy's like bigger than just my little audience look at this like these people like Arnold Schwarzenegger likes this person and took a photo with them that's amazing the second thing that they need to do is they need to get off a twitter and into real life so for example in the early 2010s when the caspers of the world were coming out uh subways in minhatten were underpriced and up for the billboards and a couple of these companies like subway oscar they go let's advertise on these billboards down in the subway and then we'll actually buy real billboards and people are like why would you do that like we could track all this on the internet and they're like well because if we get it out off the internet it's going to see more than just an online thing and it's going to feel more like a real tangible thing you know you're going to see like this ad next to like uh you know a ford ad and next to this thing it's going to feel like this is actually a little bit more legitimate and so what they need to figure out is how to do that so you do that by having real life events you do that by like getting a book that you publish you get that by getting a cameo and a tv show and you like get everyone in on the joke it's like hey everyone check this out uh they asked me to be a background on friends like here like you could see my head in that hilarious like you do these things like that where it's like real life and like bigger than just this one to ten thing and then people start taking you seriously and realize that it creates fomo and it creates um social proof and you start becoming actually culturally relevant you know what i mean and that's how you should do it so you just like take pictures with you and celebrities and then try to uh get in more in person stuff so you're off the internet and i think that would work yeah i think i think that's good advice like uh uh people will believe about you what you believe about yourself and um and also people will believe about you what they think others believe about you so if i see you hanging out you know if i see this why youtube works right like people on youtube will have like you know or instagram they'll have like they're taking a picture but it's actually the background that's the picture it's like i'm just trying to show you that i'm sitting in this car or at this place or with these people and um there's like everything that's said is actually in the background the foreground is just kind of like your excuse to say it or when kasey nice that's like walking through new york and he has kids coming up to him he goes hey what's up kid say hi to the you're on the vlog like you know what i mean it's like oh wow like in new york kasey gets recognized everywhere he's more than just what i see on my screen and like celebrities do this they like when they like tip off you know the paparazzi to come like take pictures of them and they're like they like pretend like they're trying to not be seen but then like they actually it's like a deal like hey dude i'm gonna be here come come show up and take my photo and then we're gonna use that photo for this or they'll like you know uh do stuff like that so so i think that's a thing like i had a buddy who created a um he's got like an online ecommerce brand they open up their first store the store's not going to do that many sales but just showing that hey we opened our first store in new york it's like kind of like you know wherever in new york some like small place and it's like just that makes it feel like this brand is more trustworthy it's more established it's more legit and then they had a bunch of friends like 15 friends show up and they were like doing a ribbon ribbon cutting ceremony and the friends are all like hey hey question for you like you know like trying to pretend like they're the media and and and and like if you zoomed out it's like 10 people standing in a small roster but like from the right angle it looked like a mob was at the store and again it's like this perception creates some version of reality so i definitely think that helps i don't think that's enough to build the empire i think you got to do two things one being it for like the next seven years like mr beast all these guys they didn't start with like you know as big as they are it takes like five to seven years to build something like really a truly massive the second is i would stop trying to jump off twitter and go to other places i'd be like this is where the good shit is i'm gonna master this medium and this me totally i'm gonna make it work here the third is i would do some of the stuff that just helps build fame in the first place so um i think having your lane or your niche helps because it'll attract people who are interested in that second controversy or collabing with others i think it's gonna work you know and people don't do controversial stuff really on twitter right now but it should be like oh my god i called in to like this show and i got you know how people used to call into howard stern and like get him to like say this crazy shit like check this out got him you know what i mean well some people do it that uh and it works like there's a guy who's doing this was zack weinberg or something like that yeah he's hilarious i love that guy built and sold like i don't know a two billion dollar company in like the biotech space or some shit like that but why does everybody know him because he's the guy who just will consistently shit on crypto he just is challenging people to fights about crypto and he's just trying to debate them in public and embarrass them that is this whole shtick and he's getting so much fame for dunking on people in crypto and um because there's a set of audience that likes to a watch a fight and b that likes to that is anti crypto has some anti crypto feelings and they're like he is their champion you go debate people because i don't know if i'd be able to and so that's exactly how things like hero got famous too by the way and on top of that then you have like Keith reboy or whatever people who are just like a dick to other people like he'll just like respond to somebody like wrong and they're like well explain like you know i'd love to hear your perspective and he's like i don't share my perspective with fucking losers or you know whatever he's like he'll like he'll shit on you once and then he'll even if you try in good faith to come back he'll be like the data is out there go read a book and like one time he was like one time the best thing goes i've forgotten more about startups and you'll ever even know yeah exactly or he'll be like call me after your sixth unicorn because that's where i am or whatever you know like he he's like you know obnoxiously just like shitting on people and it's hilarious and because of that like the controversy spreads some people hate him some people love him and he kind of uses that to to to grow so anyways i think controversy is also another underrated thing there's a bunch of things that people need to do but i would say the main one is like find your your angle your hook your niche like for case nice that it's the daily vlog for other people it's the explainer videos it's like whatever you got to find that for you on twitter and then like do it for five to seven years and have faith that like just like it wasn't obvious that being a youtuber was just such a big deal back then i think it's not that obvious you know to your point that you could do this on twitter too yeah i uh so that's my that's my i'm that's my pitch i think it could be cool all right can i tell you about something that i kind of knew about but has recently blown my mind yeah it's the teal fellowship so you know that's amazing what the teal fellowship is ben i'm curious do you know what the teal fellowship is come come off me for a bit because i think sam already knows i want to talk to somebody who's maybe more where the audience is which may you know aware but not familiar yeah so i know the teal fellowship is i'll tell you just my impression of someone who doesn't know a ton about it is just that it's four especially high schoolers who are super geniuses and peter teal is going to give you a bunch of money in order to not go to college and do something cool instead uh kind of you're in it's actually i think it's actually four people in college to leave college for a year so 100k to basically leave college for a year and work on something interesting and uh ben if i asked you like hey is it like successful unsuccessful do you have any idea um no except for that i know um uh what's his name did it uh the guy who did ethereum vitalic yeah exactly vitalic yeah yeah so i would say by the way i still haven't told my vitalic story on air which is i was in amsterdam and i saw him and i couldn't think what to say and he's walking right past me and i just turned him in you're vitalic and he didn't like look or say anything he just kept walking but it was him i really have security with him no he was walking all alone on the streets of amsterdam at eight a.m

in the morning it was just us our software is the worst have you heard of hub spot see most trms are a cobbled together mess but hub spot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new theorem our software is the best hub spot grow better yeah i we need to protect this man he never has security with him and he's just like wanders around random cafes and goes to events and stuff like this i'm like dude so yeah i really hope he's got such good security that you just can't see them i'll that's what i'll tell myself um so this teal fellowship thing is amazing the teal fellowship was exactly what you said uh peter teal comes out peter teal is the kind of uh a personal founder of paypal he was the first investor in facebook put 500k into facebook early on which became hundreds of millions of dollars not billions of dollars and um also you know prolific investor and a bunch of other things including space x and other businesses so peter teal comes out and he basically says college education is a bubble he says um college education is sort of a joke he's like you know you it hides under this this this like banner like it's teaching you something like you're getting information but really what you're getting is some version of like an insurance policy like i got this degree so i'm not going to fall through the cracks of society and you're getting like you know some status symbol like i got this stamp on my thing so it's like a luxury it's like a luxury product like wearing a nice bag your Harvard degree is like your Louis Vuitton bag and so he talks about college and he's like it's the costs just keep going up and up and up but the value and the the salaries that you make don't go up and so it's just like overpriced bubble just like the housing bubble he says and he says i'm going to offer um i'm going to offer something called the teal fellowship which is 100 000 if you drop out of college and go work on something interesting and a bunch of people criticize them they say uh dude i know how dare you you're telling could like the normal phrase is kids stay in school you're like we get it you're contrarian you're saying kids don't say in stay in school and you're like trying to get people to drop out like what kind of like you're worse than a vape you know and so uh you know people didn't like what he was doing and other people were just like oh it's cool but like you know who knows if this is gonna work or not like all right you're gonna pay this kid 100 grand to you know do a summer project great so what this thing is amazing it is produced yeah it worked out really well didn't it and nobody talks about it so let me tell you some of the things that have come out of this um you have like you said ethereum which is like a 170 billion dollar market cap thing that came from fatality probably like this generation's version of facebook is like you know is ethereum so that comes out of this where fatality does the teal fellowship and continues you know working on ethereum during that time and uh and he launches so that's one super super super successful thing also figma which is like a somewhere between five and ten billion dollar closer to ten company that takes on adobe in the design space and uh dylan who is you know the founder of figma was in the was in the teal fellowship uh another one oyo rooms so this is in india it's like a um you know kind of like a airbnb ish sort of thing it's like a hospitality uh you know website oyo rooms multi billion dollar company tens of billions i think luminar technologies um most people don't know this it's a like lidar company that basically uh the technology you need for self driving cars and this thing i think went public in a spack this guy's like i don't know 21 22 years old 23 years old something like that and he's worth like a billion dollars he's like one of the world's youngest billionaires if not the youngest billionaire off of this thing um that is just alone is crazy also polka dot another crypto protocol valued at you know seven billion dollars um like i just told you basically 200 billion dollars worth of business value that has come from this program and it's but then there's way more there's actually like a dozens that are in like the hundred million dollar range i invested in a company that recently raised another round i think it was owner dot com the guy adam he uh he was a teal fellow and i believe i mean that that that potentially could be a unicorn but it's hundreds of millions for sure uh and there's like dozens more like that the reason i got reminded of this was because i invested in italic and jeremy kai is the founder of italica and he was like oh yeah i was a teal fellow that's how i i was like how did we meet eventually he's like oh yeah i was a teal fellow we came to your office and you gave a talk and i thought it was awesome and so that's why we kept in touch and i was like dude was a metallic in the room he's like i don't think he's like i don't think he was at that event but he's like dude he used to like crash on our couch like you know he was part of the program and he's like he's i was like what was he like he's like he's genuinely the weirdest person ever like the weirdest person i've ever met and like he's like yeah in a good way in a bad way nothing like he's just nothing like nothing like i've ever seen just different different sort of cat and um i was like this is this is too good i think i think you should uh keep using the word cat by the way you like how i did that i've been yeah i'm workshopping right now yeah it looks good on you yeah i take it out for a spin i take it out of the garage you know you know twice a week and i just see do people kind of like flinch when i say that you know um it was a good flinch try to with lit and that was i had to put that one back in storage no you're not coming back out i put that one on ebay actually got rid of it yeah no you're yeah you're you're you're too much of a gray bush for that one but cat yeah cat was cool i would stick with cat but it is crazy man this the peter teal i thought at first it was real uh it was kind of stupid i'm like dude this is weird like one of these like little 18 year old nerds like they're not going to do anything interesting obviously i was wrong um i like i when i when i when i was like rethinking my opinion on it i was like wow i guess just like high IQ matters like these guys they're just they have more power than i do i always say they're just they're higher you're higher functioning than me you know that's just the only way i can describe it you have more horsepower your oven burns hotter and it actually it it it truly matters and it makes a difference your oven burns hotter it's so good oh god i love that that was you know what i mean they just got that they got that that heater furnace that's how i felt when i was at twitch i was like uh i was like okay let's see what are the like you know i had kind of had opinions from the outside like okay at these big tech companies what are the people like what are the exacts like what are the average people like you know how hard do they work how smart are they like you know do they have like all these processes that are way better than the messy stuff i was doing at my startup and like you know for the most part i would say it's kind of like you know i walked out a little cockier than i came in and i came in pretty cocky and that's what i was you know just sort of like oh okay like you know they don't have some magic you know processes or the people aren't that much better except like two or three people at the company one of one of which was Emmett who's the founder you know we would sit down and he there would be like you know data science would be presenting some report on like you know some trends and i'm just sitting there trying to like it's a six page memo i'm trying to like stop yawning because it's like i'm just like why do i keep yawning i'm having this like you know reflex and i'm reading this thing i'm just trying to understand these charts and like you just hear this little click and it's like someone's pen is down and it's like you you know if you're taking a math test like who's done with the test already and it would be Emmett he'd be like pens down he'd be playing heartstone on his phone and you're like no he like he must have already read this or like you know he must just skim and then then they're like all right yeah we're ready to start the discussion and he would be like so on page three you know this chart actually i noticed that the axi is a little wrong because you know if this was true then but then this other chart on page seven would show this i'm like what the you know what is happening how is your brain processing this most information this quickly and somehow always getting to like like the heart of the issue it's like we all spent our time and energy like trying to parse out what's important like he immediately got to what was important and had the conclusion and had like the follow up question and also identified why this paper wasn't very good in the first place and once i saw the brain doing that i was like oh okay there's just some cars you know have more horsepower like or as you said the oven burns a little hotter and like his oven burns way hotter than mine and i was like oh that's good to know like because i have this thing i always say i like to see what level 12 looks like like what is oh that speaker system is a little too loud for me but like i want to know what volume on 12 even is i want to feel you know my own chest leader like vibrating with the bass and it's like okay i don't want to be somebody who never sees it i want to see it what was he like in like real life like outside of work because have you ever seen some of these people interact in like normal like life like they like i told you about one friend that's like intense and he literally only owns a t two t shirts one pair of underwear one pair of socks and his laptop that's like only thing he owns that he's worth hundreds of millions of dollars and then like i know a bunch of these guys that are like this and like for hobbies they're just all in and like so if they're into like uh you know like fucking their body or something they've got like every gadget you could ever imagine and they're they could tell you all about it and or if they're into dieting they've got like their pant like my friend jack he's into uh supplements and he's got literally 30 000 dollars worth of supplements in a closet and they'd be like what's this do what's this do what's this do and he just like tests everything what was he like in uh like like was he like if he's into cars could you like tell you every single thing about like a Porsche and what year it was from and why it was special yeah yes but before i tell you about him uh i just read this thing that was like about surgey brin the co founder of google and it's like oh what is surgey like you know because he's in the news because of the his wife and elon all that stuff and some people are like what is surgey doing nowadays because he's not i don't think he's at google anymore um and it said over the last year or two he's become very into personal fitness in fact he has been trying to master several olympic sports and i was like what dude i don't know man i looked at this guy he what like what olympic sport or pig pong i don't know like sea shooting yeah curling um yeah the other one is he said he's currently writing a physics textbook and i was like of course he's writing a physics textbook like that's more like yeah um so anyways that yeah these guys are wired like that where like when they go in they go in like very deep uh and then honestly i don't know him super well because i interacted with him mostly at work um and anytime it was outside of work it was it was really cool but it was like you know limited it wasn't like a hangout with him like a hundred times it would maybe be more like five times you know something like that over the couple years that i was there um what i would say is like a couple of little things that stood out one he's like us he's an idea machine in fact i need to get him on the podcast because you've been saying that for three years now i know i know and when i was there i didn't ask him because i was like uh you know already you know me doing this podcast is not uh yeah you're like hey dude you want to bail at noon and go and record yeah it's not everyone's favorite thing i do um you know but but i think now i can do it um but he would like he told me this idea he's like i tell you about his gym idea no he's like he's like gyms he's like gyms need to be made like video games if i was gonna leave twitch i might start this uh a gym that's structured like a video game so he's like this is how it works you show up and you're like at the beginning character of a of a game like you show up and we give you kind of like your basic uniform and we have a little little wrist strap that like tracks your level of like fitness and intensity as you work out and you let basically level up and so like every time you come to the gym you're earning points and like as you earn points like we give you like better gear like we'll give you the like the the more fitted you know clothes that look cooler and so you can like visibly see people's different levels as they go to the gym you would be able to like go into certain sections of the gym that were previously locked to you you would be able to get like protein shakes and stuff for free and he's like uh he's like i think if you gamified a gym people would come more and like actually this is kind of played out with peloton peloton is very much organized like this with leaderboards and stuff like that gamification uh but i was like this is a crazy idea he's like yeah it'd be like the world of warcraft of gyms like people would grind like years of their life to level up their character to 60 and they would like work to do it he's like i think you could do that with with a gym i was like wow yeah i mean people do that with like karate and and jiu jitsu you know black belt brown belt blue belt type exactly and they stick with it they keep showing up because they're 10 plus years and he's like but you know you don't want the increments to be like a year before you see some progress like every time you come you need to be earning a little bit more and getting a little bit more unlocked you know and see that the next milestone is just within reach um so i thought that was interesting the second one he was like uh he was like trying to plug in the computer to like screen share one time with me like uh like normally these meetings are like set up by somebody else but like if it's just you two like hey you got to do it plug it in and he's like he's fucking cables he's like you know honestly i think i could create like the apple for like accessories for computer accessories he's like just like the best connecting cables the best cable management the best plugs he's like he's like nobody he's like look at this it's like every office in the world has these and look at how bad they look how ugly they are how poorly they function how confusing they are he's like i think you could just build like a really nicely designed cables and connectors and accessories company for every office in the country and like you know people would uh people would pay for it and i was like huh like why do you think of these things that this is weird and so that's what people say about you he had a dozen ideas that were like this when i was there all right that's one thing that i noticed we'll wrap this up real quick but i um there's this famous story so this guy named chris saco was a popular investor and invested in uh instagram and a bunch of other stuff in uber and he's supposed to be one of the best angel investors of all time he told this story somewhere where he is in tahoe or truckie where he has a home and he's with his dad and travis callinic right when he was about to start uber came over to just spend the weekend you know family vacation and travis and and chris saco's dad mr saco they start playing uh we tenus and travis is playing and the dad's playing and they just like are being casual and travis was like all right you want to step it up so he steps it up and he just crushes them and he just beats this guy like so bad and mr saco's like what the hell man and travis goes i've got a surprise to show you and he puts the we from his left hand into his right hand he goes i was playing left hand at the whole time i'm actually right handed let's really play and he goes travis goes all right but i do have to tell you something and they go to the ratings board and he's number two in the whole world at we tenus and chris saco was like right then and there i realized i never want to compete against this guy because his drive and his hobby is winning and he just proved that like in his free time of starting this company he's just going to be number one in the world that we tenus just cuz just because he has to and he just hustled my dad thinking that he was left handed and it worked perfectly this guy is a winner and that's why chris saco said he invested in like i just see his intensity and just walking around dude hundred percent agree peter teal is the same way as like a master or grand master at chess and like the in the paypal mafia which is now like the most successful entrepreneur group ever i think several of them were like very very high level chess players that have gone through that you know that like we're in that thing there's like something to the the oven burns hotter that's like true for some of these people it's a combination of intensity and capability that is that is definitely true like another kind of like emit observation that i was like huh that's weird that doesn't seem normal um so i guess two little ones one was i was like what do you do for fun like what do you when you hang out like what are you doing he's like oh like i love board games he's like you should come over for like a board game night and i was like uh okay like what what are we playing like you know monopoly like twister what do we got going here and he's like this is looked at me like we only pay like deep strategy games and it was like we only play katan on like hard mode or like even katan it's like the beginner one you like name two other games i don't even know about that like you know are like this the like the board games that are like actually you know like multi level multi hour strategy games and basically it was him and the brothers from stripe and like the the founder of reddit and they would just get together and play these games on the weekend that's what they did that's exactly how i want them to spend their time exactly so i thought that was kind of funny and then the other one was like um we were in a meeting and he we were talking about like i don't know like some policy like oh these you know whatever yes some girls streaming on twitch and like our nipples showing like is that okay but it's like you know she lives in denmark you know what how what are the rules around this should we ban her or like what and and so there was always these policy questions coming up over and over and over again and it felt like you can't win because whatever twitch did it was like oh dude they're trying to control us censor us like they're inconsistent they should have also changed it over here like it was a no win policy and then you know like he would he would have these like he would have these hobbies which is like reading like old books that nobody would read like no normal person's reading these books and he'd be able to connect the dots on two like completely unrelated things it's sort of like ben's podcast stuff where it's like oh actually like you know the Rothschilds similarly set this up in a you know set up their will in a weird way because of this maybe you should do this like dude how do you know all this like really specific stuff from history he would be like do you know how the potato farmers govern their like you know farms in the Netherlands during the potato drought and then like the head of policy it's just like no just tell me what he's like actually they created this governing council that was blah blah blah and like the cool thing about this rule of law was blah blah maybe we should you know you should read that like tell me what you think about it and they're like all right like where do I find this like out of print book that you read like randomly and you remember what the potato farmers did and so he would always bring these like really unrelated examples in that was one thing and the other one was he would debate you over semantics like to death so you would be like you know like it'd be like an exact offsite he'd be like and somebody be like you know I just feel like we don't have enough like trust on the team and everyone's like nodding like yeah you know like you know he's a collaboration is a problem or whatever and he'd be like well is it trust or collaboration because trust means this and collaboration means this like well you know just like the general like trust collaboration just like working together better he's like but like again define for me what you mean when you say trust I just want to make sure I have it right and he's not trying to like it's not a gotcha he wants he's like a hyper literal person so he's like when you say it's failing I take that to mean it's failing is it failing or is it this other thing and people are like just getting lost in the sauce of this like semantical debate but like he really wanted to be hyper literal about it and I've never seen anybody do this in it you know there were upsides that gave a bad example here but like I think you understand the general premise which is that he really cared about words what they mean and why we're using them and if we're using them correctly to describe what's going on and everybody else was kind of hand wavy about stuff especially like the higher you go up an organization you sort of get paid for being sort of high hand wavy like a politician and he was the opposite of that so these were some of the things I noticed that now when I invest in founders I'm like like invest in this guy who creates company called Skiyo he's like yeah I'm just like I was like what'd you do before this he's like oh it's a professional called duty player like before that I was you know I was grinding in World of Warcraft like it was a waste of time but like yeah you know top three in the world or whatever it's like what oh you were like a top three starcraft player like you know in this on the on the east coast server like okay you're a winner and you're obsessive and you are like you find the rules of the game and then you like optimize to win it and sure enough now like with his thing he's just like a wrecking ball with like acquiring customers because he just find this is the new game and he's like finding rules and he's like maximizing his edge and everything that he can do to the point where he's kind of like a nut job but like you know it works at the end of episodes like this I'm exhausted I feel like I just exerted so much energy both listening and speaking do you have to take a nap at the end of this because you just spoke like with incredibly high energy for we've done this for we're an hour and 17 minutes in do you get exhausted I take naps after no not at all I I leave these on a high so do I but then I need to go to always you well yeah you never have water I usually drink three drinks while I'm doing these but like I'm exhausted I get exhausted just listening well that's probably my fault so I'm sorry I know no it's a good exhausted I'm like god I just learned so much and I need to get so much better at this this and this by hearing this story and I was just so intensely listening and enthralled by this conversation that I need a nap I've got to go lay down I gotta go rest.

Bologi went on Tim Ferriss's podcast and did like a three hour podcast and I listened to it last night and like literally while it was happening I could feel my brain fatiguing just trying to like digest what this man was saying he's so and by the way you also hear Tim Ferriss sound I love Tim Ferriss Tim Ferriss sounds like an absolutely defeated man on these podcasts with Bologi because Bologi would be like um you know on one hand you have the woke capitalist on the other hand you have the anarcho anarcho you know the anarcho capitalist do you know what I mean when I say that and Tim's like no tell me and like that happens 40 times in the episode he's like um are you familiar with the concept of the uh you know the Schrodinger window and Tim's like um no but I assume you can tell me and he's like he just does that over and over and over dude what's happening with us he was like he was like you know bitcoin is kind of like battle the bulge and you remember how the Germans were doing it I'm like dude I don't I did an analogy for your analogy like you don't please don't reference battle of the bulge would try to explain a complicated topic like you know it's like you know bitcoin's kind of like uh like neuroscience like you know how like the chemicals of like this this and this interact this way think about the think of big going bitcoin is the amygdala of the crypto you can see yeah well what's the amygdala dude I don't know yeah that's what that's what was happening and uh I guess I did that to you in this case but no you're you're you're way dumber I could totally keep up with that it just was a good story no you just talk more no I thought it was good that was a compliment I get exhausted because I'm like so into it like I like I I love hearing these stories so much we used to do these mastermind uh like dinners or hangouts where it'd be me Sam and like three other guys and we'd meet up every two weeks or three weeks something like that and it would always be like you know each person gets 20 minutes and you just sort of say what's going on in your business what's working what and what you want help what you want the other guys to like you know basically help you think through and then and those things last basically if you just do the math it's like six people 20 minutes each but everybody runs 10 minutes over and like you know we start 10 minutes late it's like this thing is three hours long and we would always start it after work so we'd start it at like seven it would finish at 10 10 30 uh we skip dinner nobody's like gone to the bathroom and basically there was two reactions some people were like fucking exhausted by the end of this and they're like oh this was great but like man next time let's try to be a little shorter uh and like I get that logically my reaction and we used to do some of these at your office I remember uh at the hustles office I don't know if you notice I would leave your office at 10 10 30 and I would go straight to my office and I would just work four or five straight hours because I was like I can't do that I was so inspired I was like a combination of inspired by the like your guys's your guys's awesomeness um panicked that like oh my god I have so much I need to do that I now realize and like oh fuck I need to do all of this and I'm just gonna try to do as much as I can tonight uh and like I was is a combination of like enthusiasm and like feeling overwhelmed by like the amount of potential and ideas and like stuff I could be doing to make our stuff grow more no I gotta go like drink Gatorade and take a power nap like yeah I'm gonna like yeah I need to fuel up I'm gonna go eat a cliff bar I go for now I'm like my blood sugar is low I could feel it I guess that's the episode right then
