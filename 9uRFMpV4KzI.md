So basically I am we've birthed Facebook friends down so we talk a little bit there but I first met you at HustleCon I think this event that I hosted in 2019 and you're one of the best people we've ever had we've had hundreds of people and I'll tell you why two things the first I think you spoke right when so this is Max he started Grammarly we'll do an intro in a second but I think you spoke when you guys had just raised maybe a hundred million dollars at a billion dollar valuation or something like that is that right yeah that was yeah that was 120 and we didn't disclose valuation at the time but if I had to get a yeah you didn't but I think I heard rumors and like I just am guessing it was like in that range and it didn't matter but basically I made a comment to you I'm like that's pretty cool right and you you kind of replied back you weren't cocky but you were very confident in still humble but you kind of had a grin and I forget exactly what you said but it was something like yeah it's gonna get much bigger too and I loved that like subtle confidence and then at the event what you talked about I don't even remember the title but the idea was basically like you're an engineer but you've done a really good job of like evolving past just engineering and you like said this is how like I engineer like good products and this is like everything you looked at was from an engineer like about reverse engineering different stuff and I thought that was incredibly fascinating do you remember what I'm talking about oh yeah I do I remember that I actually use it mantra a lot in inside a company as well when we look at different markets and where to go next and it's just a universally good framework that works for many things yeah just kind of looking at things narrowly identifying a sweet spot and then just going broader from there.

So this is Max Litvin Litvin he started this company called Grammarly before Grammarly you had another company called like Blackboard I think right? That was not my company that was a company that bought my company so my company was MyDropBox not to be confused with Dropbox it was a plagiarism detection company and it was bought by Blackboard in 2007 and then they spent two years with Blackboard kind of a part or an out part just being there and that was like a compared to Grammarly a mild success right like it was financially good but it wasn't like this huge huge multi billion dollar company.

Oh yeah that was just a start it could have grown big but education was at that point relatively difficult market to be in and wasn't as big of a market plus our product was fairly narrow it was just doing one thing for one group of people so we kind of saw that it can grow to this point but further it's going to be very slow and very difficult so that's why we decided to sell plus we had bigger ideas. And you started Grammarly and at this point can you reveal can you reveal how big it is because I like it's shockingly large? Yeah so we raised at 13 billion valuation and we disclosed that valuation I still think it's a conservative one why because Grammarly is a very non standard company and very non standard product it's easy to see it for less than it is and that's kind of reflected often in perceptions of everyone if investors of sometimes even potential team members we have to explain why it's big and you know but that also helps with last competition.

And by the way you guys bootstrapped it for a long time so like you and your co founder like it's not like you own like 4% of this company you guys probably you own like a very substantial amount so like actually so you're on paper you're you're probably a multi billion millionaire at this point. It depends on whom you believe there is some information that's not fully accurate but yeah we we we managed to keep significant portion of the company with the founders and employees and please only actually quite a lot. Did um when I heard about Grammarly the reason why I wanted you to come on to the podcast and at HustleCon is because I think my reaction is the same reaction most people in business had which is like a this is just a chrome plugin be this is just spell check like there's no way that either of those things are interesting and then I learned about it and I was like oh this is like way bigger than it just looks like that it's way more than that.

Did most people were like there's no where most people dismissive of like it just being a chrome plugin. Some people are dismissive quite a lot and I wouldn't say dismissive it's not like completely all this nothing but underestimate the impact and the importance of it. And that's that's an interesting conversation always always very similar because they kind of think oh this is a good product this is a cool product but not for me because well I know what I'm doing and then they tried and it helps it helps the material ways and especially when you measure results because you know when you're don't measure things and I'm just you know typing away it saves you from an embarrassment or helps you phrase something more clearly kind of yeah that's cool but what's the impact of that.

I mean the money but when it's done on the business scale and it's measured in its kind of assessed you can see like percentages improvements in different metrics productivity satisfaction so on and that is up that is up. We bought it at the hustle so I had it for the whole company. I don't remember what it would have cost but I remember seeing the bill every month hundreds of dollars a month and everyone loved it and I loved it I still use it so like I totally I totally buy it I totally once I started using it I was like oh my god I get it but one thing that I've always been fascinated with is is just plugins as a business particularly two types of plugins WordPress plugins there's a bunch of guys that have like some substantially size substantial size businesses selling WordPress plugins you know like twenty five fifty million dollars a year and then Chrome plugins which do you I don't know if you like describe yourself as a Chrome plugin as a business I don't think you are but like it's definitely like the one of the main ways in which most people interact with you right.

For now yes we just recently switched over to our flagship product being operating system level integration so it works similarly to Chrome plugin except it integrates with all the apps not just web apps. So that's that was a big switch over that happened in December so just about a month ago so that's that expands the surface area for Grammarly now it's in Microsoft PowerPoint and Oracle applications and wherever wherever you want. Did you watch your higher CEO when did you do that. It's kind of jumping topics but yeah we we brought in a CEO I think in 2011 and one reason one big reason for that was that both Alex, my co founder and I we have a philosophy that everybody should be doing should be in their zone or genius doing what they like and what they are good at and nobody know one of us was really experienced or or even that passion about scaling organizations and that's what we're kind of the biggest thing we're looking for from from a CEO teaching us and doing that basically scaling the company because we realize that to do what we need to do we need a lot of people we need a big company it's a kind of a number of people and size is not a kind of a desired outcome in itself it is a necessity because the goals are so big that you can do it with 20 people or 30 how many employees did you have when you hired Brad.

I think 20 something. Oh wow nothing I mean small. Small yeah yeah we're fairly small. We were we were making good revenue and being profitable at the time already but the company was still very small and that's that's kind of a that that realization we need to the opportunity is big and we need to scale that pushed us to look for kind of external expertise. How did you because at that point you I guess you didn't raise money so you and your partner like oh it was like your business it was your company and like your money how did you how did you not micromanage Brad because I did the same thing and not micromanaging is tough because you're like oh my god if you make a mistake you're going to lose money and that's like my money and so it's like really stressful to like let someone fail sometimes and learn were you micromanaging or were you pretty emotionally healthy about it.

I like to think we were emotionally healthy maybe Brad would disagree I don't know I wish he I actually will ask him but I think part of it was out of necessity. There was just so much to do that if you're micromanaged you get stuck you don't need to make progress so there was just no time or resources or energy to micromanage anybody we had to divide and conquer to actually keep making progress because that's a lot of work so just just from the volume of things to do everybody had to do their own thing so that that happened naturally and part of it is is a philosophy that again Alex and I share that basically if you bring in smart people on board like not listening to them or not letting them think independently is a waste basically there is no point in bringing smart people on board so that's that's that made it easy to kind of give freedom and give space to to Brad and other leadership team members.

What were your goals early on like when you started the business for like man I think this can make ten million dollars a year and provide a good lifestyle or like I think this could or was it like I think this could be like a multi billion dollar thing like what were your goals early on. I think we decided that it could be a multi billion dollar business during our conversations with Brad partially so kind of Alex and I we we hoped it could be but then once we started talking with Brad about valuation plans and all that when he was thinking about joining then it become pretty clear that yes there is a multi billion dollar market out there are we gonna capture it or not to be to be determined but at that point but there is definitely an opportunity so the size of the opportunity became clear fairly early but past there that that took years to what was the vision that made or what did you see that made you feel that it could be a multi billion dollar opportunity and what was the vision and were there any was there any numbers that you saw early on that would said like oh my gosh there's something here.

Yeah so I think the breakthrough moment was when we saw that it is possible to help not just professional writers people who write for a living every day but also help casual writers or people who write as part of their job but or part of their life but not like a key part so writing is not their like main product there no no like novelists or or researchers who are published and so on so when we saw that it's possible to make a product that's useful for everybody else then it clicked in the very simple formula if you look at amount of time we spend communicating creating knowledge as a humanity as all people in the world that is a huge percentage of our time and it's increasing because we spend less time doing things with our hands manufacturing is being automated it's not like we were doing it manually anymore as much so if you take this time that we spend communicating and creating knowledge and make it even 1% more effective the impact is in trillions not not even billions so can we do something that makes communication 1% more effective on average for everybody that doesn't sound impossible that sounds like something's doable that's doable so so I had that same insight except I did it in such a horrible worst way so basically I learned how to be a copywriter so like I read books on copywriting and like on persuasive writing and my theory was like oh my gosh like with texting or like online dating I was single at the time and in 21 so it was all about like dating I'm like oh man if I were learn how to write better in my messages to girls who I match with like my life is going to be better and then I was like wait a minute if I learn how to write better I could sell more stuff if I learn how to write better I can make people feel emotions about like this cause that I want them I'm like just writing better like it changes it makes it life more practical but also it it makes you think better so like if you can if you have an idea for something and you're forced to write it out you'll see all the holes in idea and you'll and you'll force yourself to like lay it out and so I was like oh I'll teach people how to write better and so I created a course on how to write better of course like obviously creating a software product it was out of my league but like that was clearly the better move to do but the same insight was like everything that we do is via a text whether it's a text message or an email or a website and even if it's via like the spoken word I have to write that anyway so like writing is like the most important thing that you can master I just wish I would have approached it in a software way as opposed to just selling a $300 course.

Yeah software is more scalable that's true and actually what you said about writing it also applies to speech we when we do user research we notice that people who use Grammarly repeatedly adopt patterns of communication more effective patterns of communication translated to non written communication as well so for example if Grammarly keeps suggesting that you don't use kind of a wordy or vague or weak sentence structures you stop or reduce use of them in speech as well so I so kind of good habits rub off and translate to other modes of communication. So here's my opinion so have you ever heard of copy work? No.

Alright so in like the 1700s 1800s and up until like 1910 one of the ways in America that we would teach children how to write well is the same way that we would teach them how to play an instrument so if I wanted to teach you how to play the piano I'm not going to say like go ahead like write a piano song I would say well let's play Jingle Bells let's learn how to play Happy Birthday then after that we can move to like some more pop songs that you really like and then you do that for like two years and you like see patterns and you like understand you just copy other people's music and in doing that you see patterns and then eventually you're like oh I know the rules of the game now now I can decide to follow them to break them but I can make my own and it's the same thing with writing but we don't do that and so what that means is I think one of the easiest ways to learn is you find great writing that you really like and you just literally copy it by hand and in doing that you like see the patterns and that's called copy work it's not a very popular way to learn how to write now but in my opinion it's one of the most powerful I would say Grammarly in a sense is doing that because in real time you're learning but it's far better than just saying like go and write like just like spend a lot of time writing your own stuff I think copying other people is far better anyway it's something I've been playing with I'm not a lot of people have heard of copy work I thought maybe you would have but it's like not very well known.

No I haven't heard about but I've seen it done in many many fields like at one point I was passionate about photography and same there you just basically try different try to basically copy different photographs and recreate them and then this way you learn the language of that art so yeah that applies to many many areas. How technical were you in your cofounder were you technical enough to build the first handful of iterations? So I was very technical so for example the previous plagiarism detection company I wrote the core algorithm and most of the code originally most of the kind of back end code not the front end but when we were working on Grammarly I don't think I did any production code I coded some of the experiments landing pages payment check out process like some stuff that you don't even need to code anymore today if you didn't want to.

Yeah yeah yeah so I coded some of that but I didn't code like a real production great stuff mostly because I'm not a formally a software engineer I'm kind of a self trained coder but kind of building a real complex software is not my thing plus I had to manage the business full time so when we started out I was responsible for finance marketing like pretty much like lots lots of things like basically everybody has to wear a lot of hats in a small company so the branding the business occupied pretty much my whole time so was no time for for so you just hire you did you guys just sell fund it and hire a couple people to help build the first version.

We hired quite a quite a significant number of people we also had a technical co found on board Dima leader who helped to build out the technical team so he was responsible for for the technical side initially but yeah because of our previous exit we had some savings that we could put into Grammarly some substantial savings we could put into Grammarly so basically we were both founders and the first investors. How much did you spend to get to make it work until like it was a sellable product. I don't remember. Like a million or ten million five hundred thousand do you remember.

I think it was close to a million but it was a product that worked only for very small audience way very small use case and it was not real time so basically what happened was you write a book a chapter of a book because it couldn't check the whole book at once or you write a research paper you submit it to the initial like the old Grammarly and then you go make a cup of coffee and then you drink the cup of coffee and then you wait a little bit more and then it's about the result and the result was probably half of it was real issues and half of it was false positives but at the time the audience the target market was fine with that because if you spent like two months writing a book like what's extra half an hour to review all the potential issues right even if they're not real but that won't fly with with business writers for example if you're writing a business email that you need to send in 20 seconds you're not gonna deal with false positives and did that version get you to profitability yeah shit what you charge for $100 a year we charged I think $90 a year something like that yeah yeah we're hundreds so yeah I think $95 a year how did the people hear about it the first users so that was interesting because we launched two peril streams one to consumers and one to businesses educational institutions publishers basic companies consulting companies and the consumer channel to cough like it grew exponentially from basically week one and enterprise or B2B it took a longer to build so once we kind of pushed both of them in parallel for about half a year we saw that well kind of makes sense to focus on consumer for now because it's just growing like wildfire but B2B requires much more pushing much more hiring more people intensive because you need sales team and all that so we kind of decided to slow it a little bit and focus on consumer for first few years and do with it to paid marketing or organic we did everything we tried all the channels available to us and obviously different channels have different benefits at the time social was also easier to get free promotion from right now obviously kind of Facebook and others just want to capture all the value they create but back then it was easy to get easier to get stuff viral on social and just get free promotion from that SEO was easier as well so many things were just like many channels were quite easier to do but we relied on paid early on quite a bit because it's a it's a very quick feedback you design an ad you send it or kind of put it in the system and then you get back results like within hours and it tells you if the message resonates if there is a market for that if you're finding that market correctly you know that within like hours it's in more traditional world it's a week so 100 thousands of dollars yeah so that's that was that was kind of why we were so bullish on paid from early on even though it costs a lot of money what companies are you guys trying to buy companies not specifically I mean we're open to that but we're not like hunting to buy is there a problem that you need to be solved and then you saw that this other company was solving that problem that you'd buy it so like let me give you an example the the founder of jet you know jet com they sold the Walmart for some billions of dollars and he's like man if Walmart if we could figure out a way how to reduce returns by helping people pick the right sizes we would buy that company for a lot of money is there anything inside of Grammarly we're like man we haven't figured out blank yet but if someone did figure out blank that's a cool company we would buy that's a cool problem solve that we would buy yeah there are many things like things around doing more on device like doing more and more processing on device I think that that that would be very interesting to us because it didn't it enables better user experience lower lag potentially higher performance it also helps alleviate some potential privacy concerns so kind of a no brainer to do more stuff on device and it's cheaper for for for us to sorry what does that mean you mean like instead of you paying for all this cloud space for everything for the for yeah yeah calculating the suggestions on device so basically whenever we say oh this needs to be shorter or rephrase it like that making that determination on your phone or on your laptop rather than sending it to cloud and having our servers crunch numbers so that's that's kind of a that that that has number of benefits for for both actually I don't know what those costs are so how much does it cost to like what percentage of your revenue do you spend on or maybe like how does the payroll compare the payroll cost compared to like your hosting costs I would say it's comparable hosting costs are like even though we don't host much of the data like we're not like draw box where we store files but the processing the processing is quite expensive especially if you consider that we have tens of millions of free users who are not paying us anything and we're not we don't monetize them in any way at all because we don't we don't sell user data we don't show ads we don't do any of that so basically all the free users are not monetized until they subscribe so that that makes it that makes us be conscious of processing costs especially for regions where not many people can upgrade to premium like developing countries how many employees do you have I don't recall exactly but I would say somewhere on the damn so then you're paying a shit ton for those that hosting yeah I would say it could be less than pure I don't remember exactly but yeah it is significant amount I mean that then you supporting that many users and providing a reliable service it does who do you pay it's mostly I'm a crazy man like it just runs the internet it's crazy well yeah we evaluate from time to time bring in some things in house and actually some things we do have in house not not necessarily like the hosting infrastructure but like some train model training and all that stuff we do in house but so we look into that so it's not like we're just Amazon and forget it but it is an effective way to scale business isn't effective with yeah it's just like crazy that it's crazy that it always freaks me out a little bit that like we use cloud flare and I remember one time cloud flare went out and like our website was dead and so was like a quarter of the internet yeah yeah it's it is this concentration it is kind of scary yeah it freaks me out a little bit yeah it has its benefits but it is yeah a lot of places have a single point of failure for significant portions of our infrastructure are you and we'll wrap up here in a second but I asked you about Hemingway earlier do you do you view them as competitors at all not really no they do something that's similar and something that's basically part of what we do and number of people use both products simultaneously so we don't view them as a competitor because they don't take business from us so yeah so it's not like who do you view as a competitor who do we use a competitor well the biggest one is complacency just people not realizing that they can benefit from this I think that that's the biggest thing that by far bigger than any any other competitor but other than that once you get to certain size everybody becomes a potential competitor because you know when you look at big tech companies they all compete in some ways and all do some things that are similar or the same so that's that's kind of the mindset that basically at any point anybody can become a competitor yeah but are there any I've never seen any like upstarts or any small companies try to compete with you guys is there is there many there are some but most are focusing on either niche like a primarily for a specific market and I think that's that's a good way to start and obviously we're watching them and seeing what they're doing right what they're doing wrong and so on there there there's similar products Microsoft I think has a similar product but again it only does part of what we do so it doesn't take away much business from us so if any so so yes and I wouldn't I wouldn't say that there are any kind of direct competitors at this point and I'm not too worried about competition frankly because it's just such a new field that most of the market is just untouched by anybody.

Cool thanks for coming on I'm gonna we're gonna wrap up now and I'm gonna let you know when this is live it should be live in like a week I think but I appreciate you coming on it means a lot. Great thank you thank you so much for having.
