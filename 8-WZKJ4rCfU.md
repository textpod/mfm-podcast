Model: Whisper-small

What is it about this writing style that's so slippery that I just can't get it's like a tick tock feed. I can't get out of it, you know. And so I would say it's like more like a door where you kind of got to go knock and take a leap of faith that there is something on the other side of this. You can't see exactly what you're going to get until the door opens. All right, we're live. Cool sweatshirt. What's going on? Oh, dude, I already told you I couldn't. I can't talk about it on on air, but I am.

You know, there's some days where a fire there's a fire on the third floor and you got to grab the extinguisher and go put it out. And so that's what I've been doing today is putting out. And I'm glad that I did this, which is we had a bunch of family coming in town for Thanksgiving. Wife was like, oh, yeah, it's great. We got my sister coming. We got this person coming. This person's coming from India. It's like, oh, God, OK. She's like, you know, we should host Thanksgiving. I said, you know, I love the giving spirit.

I love the idea, but we're not hosting anything on Thanksgiving. Why? Because we have an ecommerce company and Black Friday is the biggest sales day of the year. And she said, well, what are we going to do? Like, you know, it's just going to sell online. Like we're not going to go to the warehouse or something and go fulfill it. You know, so what do we do? I said, sometimes you got to create space because you just want to be available. You want to have buffer. You don't want to be fully booked in case you need to do it.

Maybe you have an idea that something you could do to drive sales or in this case, what if shit absolutely hit the fan and you had to do something to recover, which is exactly what happened today. I created space. My COO was like, oh, I'm just going to go pick this person up from the airport that day. It should be no problem. Guess what? She's in the car, the shit's hitting the fan and she can't get to a computer and she did not create enough space. And so that was a great lesson. That's an evolution for you because you are not the man at creating space.

I was not a space creator. That's that's come with, you know, some gray hairs and wisdom is this idea. So I'm glad I did it because shit's hitting the fan today. And, you know, I'm just hoping that I told you before this, I'm hoping that, you know, my safety, my savings, my under the mattress savings of good luck needs to be cashed in today. I'm just I'm reaching under the mattress. I'm hoping it's still there. I feel like I put it there. I'm hoping that good luck is still there. I need it today. Well, OK, so I've got.

So what we're going to we're going to talk about products and media that we like. But and I have a couple. I have one thing in particular that's going to make a difference on your day today, actually. OK. We can talk about it later. But so today's episode is we're going to talk about products and media that we've consumed throughout the year that we think are cool, because I like talking about gadgets and media. And so do you. The stuff that you talked about last last episode was actually quite amazing. That article about data and how it's easy to read data.

Yeah, just kind of like a great find is kind of is that the idea? Great finds. These are exactly finds we've had this year, whether it's a product or it's a piece of content. Great finds. I think that's in the Thanksgiving spirit. It's like, you know, being thankful for it. But also people have time over there. Hopefully people are creating a little space. You know, you spend a family time and but but people have time over the holidays. And there's a good chance that you to buy this as a gift for yourself, for somebody else or to just check something out that you haven't tried before.

All right, well, let's start. Do you you name one and I'll name one or I can have a couple. What do you want to do? OK, let's do. Let's do. I think we both have an app that we really like. Two different apps. So let's do the category of apps. So what's a great find you had that's an app this year? OK, unfortunately, a lot of things I might name are going to involve fitness. A lot of them are going to be money related. Fitness influencer life. Bro, yeah, a lot of them will be money related, though, actually.

And relaxation and mindset. So the first one zero. It's called zero. I believe Kevin Rose started it. OK, so I I never thought that I was intermittent fasting, but in order just not to overeat throughout the day, I just wouldn't eat breakfast. Turns out that's called intermittent fast. Is that that's not why I did it. This app called zero. It's free. They have a paid version, which honestly, I don't think it does anything. But the free version you you you say when you had your last meal and it just tells you don't eat until and then you in my case, it's 16 hours.

It's awesome. I love it. I can't believe how that one app actually makes me want to stick to it as opposed to when I'm on my own. So that that app has made a meaningful change in my day. What are you fasting? You're doing 16, eight. Are you doing more intense than that? I do. I do 16, eight. So basically I'll stop eating at 8 p.m. And I'll eat again at noon. Right. So that means 16 hours. I'm not eating eight hours eating. And when you eat in your eight hours, are you like, you know, eating kale salads or you eat whatever you want in those eight hours? What do you I don't eat whatever I want.

I usually eat meat and vegetables. That's what I work hard. Do you size or no portion sizing within that eight hours? You're fine. You eat to your full. Yeah, I portion control. Yeah, definitely. I very. Yeah, for sure. I try to eat 2,500 calories a day. Good. Good. All right. So I have anything else on zero. I think that's a that's a good one. That's a good app as well. I like it. It's a super clean interface. Like I like apps that just do one thing really well. And that's what that does. OK, here's an app.

I think I've talked about this, but I got big into breathwork. And so there's two apps that if you want to have kind of like a happier life, there's a lot of apps that will distract you. Instagram, TikTok, whatever. There's apps that will make you more productive, but they'll distract you from the real world. That's like email, Slack, maybe Twitter. And then there's apps that actually center you and ground you. And so my phone had enough of the distraction apps. I had enough of the productivity apps where I was lacking was, hey, how can I use this magic wand? That's how I think of my phone.

It's a magic wand I make. I just I install an app and that's like a spell that I just could do some magic. They I can get food to appear at my doorstep or I can, you know, some in a car or I could do all kinds of different crazy stuff. I can put my, you know, my mom thousands of miles away, her face can show up on my phone. Well, this one gets me grounded. And so there's two apps I want to call out. One, I think we've talked about for us called the five minute journal.

I ended up meeting the guy who made this app. It's an app. I thought it was a notebook. There is a notebook and then there's the app apps. I think that's cool. It's a paid app. I think it's three bucks or five bucks or something like that, which is so funny because when I saw that, I was like, I don't pay for apps. I was like, wow, like my threshold for paying for shit on a phone is so low compared to like, you know, a parking. It's a parking meter. But I get to use this app forever.

That's some guy created and coded and makes it do all these things. So five bucks. And what it does is you open it up and it basically just has a quote while it loads. It's always a good quote. The dude, they have good selection. And then it basically says one of three things you're grateful for today. And the act of writing those down is great. It looks great. You know, not to get super cheesy, but basically the more grateful you are, the less stressed you are. You cannot be grateful and stressed at the same time.

You cannot be grateful and afraid at the same time. You cannot be grateful and angry at the same time. So if you just want to not be any of those bad things, just focus on being grateful rather than not being whatever. It's like when you tell somebody relax, when they're really pissed off, guess what? They don't really relax very well. So you're telling somebody to not be angry or not be stressed doesn't work. But telling, but getting somebody to shift their focus to being grateful works actually really well. What questions does it ask? Just as what three, what three things happened today that you're grateful for? And it's today, it's things that happen today, not like what are three things in your life that you're grateful for? Then you just sort of monotlessly say, my health, my family and my friends.

It's like, no, what happened today that I'm grateful for? What's a moment of today? And then it forces you to slow down time because you're like, shit, what did I even eat for lunch today? What did I do today? And then you're like, you think of one thing and you're like, God, there must have been something more than that that I'm grateful for. You kind of suck at it the first day. They suck at it the second day. By the third day, something happens during the day and you're like, ah, I'm going to write this in the app tonight.

Like that's the thing. And so it forces you during the day to actually take note of what you're grateful for, which makes you a more grateful person. All right. So that's what now. Let me just tell you something really quick. So Andrew Huberman, one of the things on my list, Andrew Huberman recently had a new video come out called the science of gratitude and how to build a gratitude practice. Andrew Huberman was on our podcast. He's got this amazing podcast and YouTube channel where he talks about the science behind different things and how you can use it to help you.

And his latest thing is on gratitude and he says that he's been doing gratitude and I don't want to get into the science, but basically there's something about like the prefrontal cortex and how gratitude actually releases double mean and it's proven to make you more motivated and happy. And he said a lot of people, including him, did exactly what you did. And he goes, I think that's works, but we have loads of studies that show that the actually slightly more effective way is to do one of two things. And I believe those it is, um, you try.

You try so the most effective thing is that you, you read or you remember, you read something that someone has written to you. And so someone's expressing gratitude to you. Of course, that's not entirely practical, right? And so there's a few things that you can do. The first thing is that you can think of a story when someone was helpful to you. And if you focus hard enough, it actually feels real. And the second thing that I do mean, my wife is every couple of days, we have a set time that we sit down and we say, here's what I'm thankful.

I'm thankful that you did this. And then the second thing that you can do is you can actually think of a story and what's to do the opposite. We just say everything. We hate about each other every two days. And, uh, and then we get, I get it off our chest. She loves, she's really good at the game. I'm getting better. Uh, it's just, it's a good thing. It's called the hateful eight. Just eight minutes of just like hanging on each other. Um, and, uh, the second thing that you could do is you can think of a story of someone being helpful to another person.

And they put these guys, I believe in a MRI and they scan their brain and they watched a movie or a story about Holocaust survivors being helped and surviving. And it like changed something in their brain and it was proven to make them more motivated and happier. Why is that the most convincing thing ever? Everything that they're like, they did an FMRI study. They scan people while they watch this. The brain lights up like a Christmas tree. It's like the most like that's the most I'm just going to make that up. Whenever I want to be more convincing with my thing.

I'm like, yeah, people who buy my, my power writing course, uh, we've done brain scans. It shows that actually they're there. You know how there's a part of your brain you can't access with this course. You actually access it. The scans, they speak for themselves. I did a transcendental meditation thing and, uh, it's like a style of meditation and they like, I went to the seminar and they're like, it's proven with brain stands to be different than mindfulness. And I was like, really? I mean, like you're both, you're the kind of the same thing. You're being quiet and just like, like, I don't understand how, but anyway, that's what they said.

So anyway, go ahead. Your second thing. Well, one more on that great, great. Full of this thing. There's one other technique that I, it's less convenient, but when you do it, it's awesome. It's called flooding. Have you ever heard of this? No. All right. Flooding is when you basically you create a flood of memories of great moments in your life. The easiest way to do it is you open up a photo album and you flip through it or you go through your camera roll. So if like me and my wife, we get together, we'll have our camera roll open and we'll just be showing each other photos from, you know, three years ago.

Remember that trip? Remember that day? Remember this thing we did laughing about it? What happened that day? And just if you just do that for even 10 minutes, you just revisit those photos. I'm not a big photo guy. I actually hate taking photos in the moment. I find it to be just incredibly like off putting and my wife's like the opposite. She loves taking photos of everything, but I got to admit this flooding shit is amazing. It works. I literally love her more after we do it because I remember all these amazing times I've had with her.

And I don't have to try. I just like look at the photo and it's there. It's better than better than my imagination. So that's what you're going to have to do today in order to get over your heartache, your money loss. I know, I know. We'll have to figure it out. One more app. One more app. So the other app is called Other Ship. So this is this just came out. I invested in this thing because I'm a believer in it. I struggled with meditation. Meditation was very hard for me. So even though I was friends with the founders of calm and they gave me a free account or whatever, never really used it.

Couldn't, couldn't get myself to enjoy doing it. And I'm the type where if I don't enjoy it, it's just very hard for me to stick with anything I don't enjoy. I don't have enough willpower, don't want enough willpower out of what it is, but I'm not great at it. So I wanted the benefits of meditation, but I didn't enjoy doing it. Breathwork has become like a revelation to me. It's a form of meditation. It's very similar, but focusing on breath and a guided breathwork session. So I've tried Wim Hof, loved it. Wim Hof has a great app too.

It's a free app. And other ship is like a souped up version of Wim Hof. And this guy, Robbie, created it. He's amazing at it. He guides a lot of the meditations himself. He built his own like home oasis in his, he was like really early at Ethereum. He like, he was the first marketing guy at the Ethereum Foundation when it was like whatever, you know, 60 cents or some shit. It's just like mega rich. So he got like, you know, even with barely putting any money in, he got like kind of loaded and then he sold some of it and was like, okay, I'm going to turn like half of my, I'm going to make this huge like kind of cabin out of the garage type thing, like a mega garage.

He turned it into like this like 20 person sauna plus cold plunge plus like amazing meditation room plus greenhouse and all this other shit. You went to it. No, he's invited me. It's in Canada. I haven't gone yet, but it's amazing. He hosts a lot of people there. He invited us actually. So you're welcome to go anytime. And they do like guided whatever, like micro dosing LSD, if you want to do that or whatever, you can do, you can do anything, you can do anything in this place. Long story short, he got really into breathwork along this journey.

And now this is what he does. He's like, I'm going to, I created this app. I'm going to, I'm going to bring breathwork to the masses and I do it every morning and it's amazing. So that's my other ship is the name of the app. All right. I dig that. All right. I'll tell you one. All right. So there's this subreddit that I go to and I love it. It's called a fat fire. And the idea is people who want to retire relatively young with a lot of money so they can live a fat life without working.

And there's this guy. And so basically if you post on there a lot, the mods, the community leaders of the subreddit will verify your net worth to make sure you're not full of shit. By the way, did you have a goal like this? Like I want to retire by X age or I want to be like this wealthy by this age. What was your like, how did you phrase your goal? How did you phrase your goal? I wanted to have $20 million by age 30. Gotcha. All right. That's what I wanted. That was my goal.

I created that goal when I was in my when I was like 19 or 20 years old. All right. I mean, I can't confirm or deny, but you know, mission accomplished is what I would say. I sold my couple. I achieved it at 31. I sold my company at 31. Right. And so that was my goal because I asked a rich person who I knew. I asked him how much money do you spend a month? And they told me $60,000 a month. And at the time I was like, I don't know. Like I can't imagine there's a world where I would.

That sounds absurd. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like, that just sounds crazy, but whatever. Like I asked like eight people and this person had the highest number. And I was like, okay, I'll just do that because I'll be conservative. And then if you withdraw only 3% of your 20 million, that gives you like $600,000 a year to spend there. That's that number. So I just fire philosophy and fire stands for financially independent retire early. So that's. Yes. So that's so you can, you can, you can spend a percentage of your portfolio of your liquid portfolio and basically it continues to grow.

Have enough money that the earnings of the sort of compounding earnings on the money being invested in something safe, like the stock market, SAP 500 type of thing can, can cover your burn rate. So there's two things that matter. What is the, what is the amount that I have invested and then what is my life burn rate? That's why a lot of people who like fire, they go move to like, you know, bump, fuck, you know, middle of nowhere and they let it like, oh, yeah, I got rid of my car and it's great. Now I can, you know, I got rid of everything I own and me and my wife, we only eat apple cores and now we are retired.

It's like, but fat fire is different. Fat fire is like, no, I kind of want to ball out. I'm not trying to like skimp on my lifestyle. So, okay, what do I need to achieve and what do I need to optimize while still not giving up like what I find to be enjoyable in terms of lifestyle? Yeah. So that's how I made up that number. And I don't even, I spend $15,000 a month. So I don't spend even close to that, but I saw this thing yesterday, which is somebody was saying they posted like my company.

Here's what my company's revenues were for the things that Chris Cantino. It was like, oh, companies revenues for the first seven years. And it was like, you know, 0,000, 20,000, 50,000, 150,000, 350,000, 7 million, 21 million or something like that. Right. I'm making it up. But it's some slow build and then suddenly things really take off. And I think they sold their company. It was a soap company, I think, for $100 million. I think I have that right. Is that correct? You know this guy? No, I know who you're talking about, though. He tweets great stuff.

You said his name, right? Yeah. So, okay. So, so he tweeted that and I started to get me thinking. I was like, it's true. A lot of success, I would say the common, you know, when success comes through the front door, this is how it arrives slowly and then suddenly. When it rains, it pours for sure. It rains, it pours. And I started thinking, OK, is that true in my life? And I started writing down. I wrote down how much money I made from the age 20 to the age 31 because I also got wealthy basically at 31.

And and it was like, you know, $0,000, then negative $30,000. But that first start up, then I got a job and the job paid me $120,000. I thought I was doing great. That was 120, 120, 120. And then went to 160 and then it stayed there for a bit. And then I totaled it and I said, wow, at age 31, I made more than the previous eleven years before that combined. And I was like, you know, this is my advice to young people always is if you're going to take a non traditional path like entrepreneurship or betting on yourself rather than a corporate career track, corporate career track, you should be increasing, you know, every two years by a certain fixed percent and you're great.

That's your lifestyle. If you take the non traditional path, you go try to be a content creator, entrepreneur or something else. It's going to be this slowly, then suddenly path. And don't if you're 22, don't count your earnings at 22 or 23 or 24. You're going to check the scoreboard at age 30 was my motto, my advice to. Or or regardless of 30 or not, after like eight or nine years, you give it give it a decade and you what you need to is total it up in 10 years. How did I do versus counting every year? Because you're going to lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, win big.

And that's off. That's often the path. So I was curious for you, if you did that, is your path similar or if you charted it out for 20s to 30s? I don't know if you want to share the exact or whatever. But yeah, I can share some. I mean, when I sold, I had saved a like seven figures. Of course, that includes my wife and I, and she also worked at Airbnb. And so Airbnb went public and she had worked there for a long time. Airbnb went public in December. I sold my company in February.

So it was like December 1st and then like February 1st was like that those two or three months was like massive. Right. And so, but prior to that, ignore that, take her out because we don't want to put her business out there. So let's just talk about you. Um, in your early twenties, what were you making? So, um, from age 22 to probably 26 and 27, I paid myself something like two grand a month. So in the brain, so the first year of business, I probably paid myself $20,000 for the first year and then I paid myself $40,000 for the next two years.

And then, um, $70,000. And then the last year that was 24k a year and then 40k a year. And then you said 70k roughly, you know, it was like 20, 40, 40, 70. Yeah. So that's four years in. And then the year we sold, I'd paid myself close to $300,000. Right. Um, and I had a few other investments, like some angel investments and, um, like some weird things that kind of paid off, but basically like for the longest time, I mean, I was living, I, the way I rigged it was in San Francisco, my rent was only $400 because I rented out this big place and I only had 25 grand in my name and I spent all of it to rent out and furnish this place.

And then I rented it out to people who basically subsidized it for me. So I was living like a poor person. And, um, so I was able to save a little bit of money. You're living like a, like a wealthy person. Really. You were living in a place and it was only costing $400 a month, which is great example, by the way, because there's a lot of people that will be like, uh, why don't we have to save Cisco, but I can't afford it. All you're saying to me is I lack creativity and resourcefulness because what you did is available to everybody.

Go find a place that's at market or slightly below market price. And what you did, I think, is you cut a deal with the landlord. You were like, I'll never call you for anything. Yeah, I told them it breaks. I'll fix it. You, I think you lived there for like a decade or some shit and you'd never call me like seven years. Yeah. Seven years to the person. Yeah. I never saw him. I had not one set of I ever seen him at the house. You wouldn't know who the heck it is. I would not.

I don't even remember what he looks like. I couldn't even tell you what he looks like. I think his name was Chris. And so you cut this deal and you were like, look, I'm you basically became the landlord. Well, I showed, I showed up and I was 22 and it was a $4,000 or five. I forget how much was it, $4,500 a month for a four bedroom house. And he goes, is it just you? I go, look, it's just me right now, but I'm going to get like some friends to move in. I'll like sign a lease, a sub lease with them and I can have you approve it.

Right. But basically like I'm going to pay you on time all the time. And my, the preferred relationship you and I have is I never see you again. And are you okay with that? And he goes, yeah. He goes, don't, don't be late. And I go, okay, deal. And we were never late. I never go one time. I'm an idiot. Once I shot a BB gun in the toilet and it broke the toilet. And so we just went to Home Depot and like bought a toilet and just replaced it. You know what I mean? So we would do stuff like that all the time.

If somebody said, hey, which of your friends shot a BB gun into the toilet? I feel like, I feel like, oh, you know, Sam, Sam's great. He's a great guy. I bought, we bought like an airsoft gun or something. We're like, let's see how strong this is. And we could have anyone to shoot it in the house because it went through the couch. Anyway, anyway, yeah. And so at this point, yeah, so it was a slow build. It took like five, six, seven years. But then what's crazy is I'm 32 now. I started hustling at age 20, probably 20, like making like real money on my own, like livable money.

And at this point at age 32, I'll make more this year from a couple like side investments, like a real estate deal that I did. I'll make more this year than collectively all of my salaries combined while working at the hustle. Exactly. And that's that's the exact same same case for me. And I think that's actually really common. And I think the reason I bring that up is because it's interesting to me. B, I think that's really comforting to people because when you're in it and you're not making any money and it looks like other people are all making hell of money, it feels it can feel very bad.

And you can question if you're on the right path or not. And this doesn't mean you're definitely on the right path, but it means. When this path of entrepreneurship works, that's commonly what it looks like. So don't be surprised. All right, so let's get back to which, by the way, when I was getting going, I was always so envious of other people like my friends. I'm like, fuck, you got a job at Google. You make a hundred and fifty grand a year and you have all these benefits. I haven't been to the doctor forever. This is awesome.

I'm so jealous. So you'd come to my office and you'd be like, this is your office. And I'm like, yeah, yeah. And then you'd be eating something. You'd be like, is this cheese just always available? Whose cheese is this? They just bring out cheese. I felt like I would bring it up. You'd be like, look, this cheese is from Whole Foods. This is expensive cheese. I'm like, bro, stop talking about the cheese right now. But it was like, I remember you were noticing all those things in a funny way. I was like, you guys have an espresso machine? Yeah, she's got a woman's bathroom.

What the hell is an espresso machine? Yeah, I remember I was like freaking out that you had an espresso espresso machine. I was like, what the hell is this? And I remember like I used to take food to go. So anyway, yeah, it accumulated quickly. And I think it for most people, it's I mean, it like I think that it's basically it's like you're poor, you're poor, you're poor. And then it's like suddenly it's like, oh, holy crap, I'm not anymore. And you know, you have that moment. And there's this subreddit called Fat Fire, and they talk a lot about that.

And there's this guy who has a series of threads called Confessions of a Hector Millionaire, and he's doing like eight parts. And I link to it in there. I see part five here. Yeah. And the mods have basically approved it. So basically the mods have like this guy DMed him, DMed his accountants or account information or something. So they like verified that he's as wealthy as he is. But basically in the beginning thread, he says, you know, I'm worth north of a hundred million dollars. I got wealthy originally because I was an employee at a tech company that made me thirty million dollars.

And that was like 15 years ago. And then I invested in this and then I did this and then I did this. And I'm going to answer a lot of the questions that I think a lot of people ask here and the mods have approved that I am who I am. And I'm going to tell you all about work and purpose, my time and routine, why I keep a little profile, how relationships are complicated, what I spend on a monthly basis, what my investment in portfolio management is. And it's incredibly fascinating. I love this stuff where you get behind the scenes of people who you normally never have access to.

And so it's a great series. It's a great thread. It's awesome. Awesome. I love it. Great find. Okay. Let's do some more. So what do I want to do? Okay. Let me do. You want me to do a quick one while you're thinking? Do a quick one. Okay. And I can keep right on. So you just let me know. So all right, this is a little black hat here, but I'm going to tell you. So there's this company called, I think it's made by the same company. It's called Web Archive. It's the greatest thing ever.

I love Web Archive. And they have got this side project called Archive Today. So archive dot today. Have you ever seen this? Yes, I have seen this. It is awesome. So if you ever want to read, so there's a bunch of products out there on how to read articles that are paywalled or behind some type of like thing that you can't see them. So there's outline.com, which is kind of cool. There's this other one that's called 12 foot and it's called 12 foot ladder. And so it basically says show me a 10 over the paywall.

Yeah. So listen to the tagline. Show me a 10 foot paywall. I'll show you a 12 foot ladder. Brilliant, right? Genius. Brilliant. And it doesn't work all the time. It doesn't work very well. That's the problem with 12 foot. Yes. But our archive today works. I've never used it and it not work. And so if you ever want to read something and you don't feel like paying the paywall, like you just want to read like article and not all like pay for it. Archive Today is the greatest thing I've ever seen. Yeah. And the Internet Archive is just like a treasure, right? Like it's a nonprofit thing.

It's a great way to go look up. What did the original version of Archive Today look like? What did the original version of the Airbnb website look like? You can go to the Way Back Machine, which is something they've created. And you can type in Airbnb.com. You can go back and you can see, oh, wow, it used to be called airbed and breakfast. And it was like catered to conferences because that's how they initially got their start and blah, blah, blah. So, you know, the Internet Archive, which is the nonprofit behind it, is amazing. They actually bought our friend's company.

They bought Xavier's book company as well because they're going to like scan all the books and make them available for people and things like that. So they just it's amazing. You know, they're based in inner sunset, right? Where my office was. That's right. That's right. OK, let's do some more. OK, so I basically made a pretty big and I think at the at the risk of us sounding like kind of like overly obsessed with fitness, which is like ironic, because at least at least you're ripped. So I think you can get away with being obsessed with fitness.

I'm not ripped yet. So it's like a little bit. It's a little bit weird when I talk too much about it. I made a big investment in this because. And your and your improvement has been massive. I basically when I was how much did you weigh when we first started filming? Do you know? I have no idea. But I basically gained like 40 or 50 pounds over the course of like my last startup and like never lost it. So you think you weighed like 250? Not 250. I think the most I ever was 225 and I don't even weigh much less than that now.

But it's a different weight. It's it's yeah, it's like muscle versus fat. It's like converting, right? So. So yeah, I basically, you know, ballooned up again. You know, I used to be one 75 or whatever. And then all of a sudden I'm 225 and felt really bad. And, you know, it's not healthy. It doesn't look good, all this stuff. I would when I would see a photo of myself, I think that's a bad photo myself. And after three years, I'm like, hey, how come all the photos are just bad photos of me? Oh, wait, maybe I'm like actually just like massively out of shape here.

So I invested in basically three or four things now that have paid off. And I'll tell you one that I don't think paid off. So so I think fitness takes a couple things, at least for me. And that's time. So I was like, OK, what are some things that I if if going to the gym is taking too much time, what's a way that I can hack that? So first of all, I built a home gym so there's no going anywhere. But even me, you could put a peloton right next to me. That doesn't mean I'm going to ride it.

You could put my foot in the straps. It doesn't mean I'm going to push like there was many reasons for many years that I didn't exercise regularly. And so one was just bringing the gym home. Then I got a trainer because I said, well, if some dude shows up, I'm not just going to ignore him like I'm clearly going to like do the workout. I think that's the biggest thing that made a difference. Like I have a friend who is who is a wealthy guy and he was like, hey, can you tell me what to do? And I'm like, no, man, get a coach for like 250 bucks a month and they'll tell you what to do and you don't think you just do what they say.

And he was like, that's really expensive. I'm like, dog, you live in a four million dollar house. Like why do you like? Why do you like your body's your house and you're going to spend $300 or something to fix it? Yeah, that's wild. But my dad does that. My dad's like, oh, you spend on this personal trainer five days a week. Like that's crazy. I have this trainer I found in India. He just does it on zoom and he's only four dollars an hour. I was like four dollars an hour. He's like, yeah, he wanted six, but I got him down to four.

He was so proud. And I was like, oh, that's I mean, that's amazing. OK, is it good? An Indian thing to do. Yeah, he's really good. He's really fit. No, no, I was like, no, he's good for you. He's like, oh, well, I don't really do it. Like, you know, it's like it's only four bucks. I don't even mind if I skip it. I was like, exactly. Like you literally don't do it. It's not working for you. You're not exercising regularly. You're not getting in better shape. So is it really that good? So anyways, I invested in a bunch of stuff and I took an approach which was like I wanted to leave myself no outs.

So I took it like burn the boat strategy. So first I talked about it publicly and I talked about it publicly because if I talk about it publicly, I'm going to be humiliated. If you know, I'd feel embarrassed if I talk about this and I don't do it. I don't back it up. Same. I think that I vouch for that. I made it super convenient. So I did home gym and I had a trainer come to my house. I paid the extra to make sure that that happened. OK, so now I'm doing the workouts. OK, cool.

Now, how do I do it where I actually enjoy it? Well, I invested in making the space nice. So like I went to your gym and I was like, wow, this feels great. I need to get a floor like this and I bought these rubber tiles and I did all this stuff to make the gym feel better. And I like got like the sound system. I did a bunch of things to make the environment one where I would not dread going there. I would enjoy. I would want to go there and a bunch of things like that.

So those were all great investments. I felt like a great find for me was like these little rubber tiles and it took time and energy to research these and I didn't outsource this. I was like, no, I need to find the best one because I want this to feel a certain way. And I crafted that kind of vision for myself. Same thing. I just got a sauna set it up yesterday. Did the first sauna session in it and I'm like, this is amazing. It's sick, right? Already. Already, this is one of my great purchases of the year.

And I just have had it for one day. I got this clear light sauna infrared sauna. And I know that some people are like, don't do infrared and some people are like by this other brand instead or whatever. No, clear light. It's good. Clear light is a great brand. But some people are like, you should do the dry sauna, not the infrared. From what I could tell, it's totally fine. And it's importantly, it fit into my life, whereas the other one would have required like a whole bunch of like waiting for like a bigger space and electrical and all those changes to be made in order to work.

As long as it can get hot enough, it's good. Yeah, exactly. So those have been for me the best find. Now, here's the worst the worst buys and the worst things I did. I anything that I attached to my wrist has just failed. So I bought an Apple watch, lost it. All right. Got stolen slash lost. I don't want to happen. It was at the office and it was gone. Second one bought a Fitbit lost it. Whoop band have it. Battery's dead. Don't charge it regularly enough for it to be useful. So everything I've tried, that's like a fitness tracker that is like a wearable device.

It doesn't work for me because I'm too disorganized. And lose shit and don't keep things charged and ready for the morning and then charge it for sleep. I had an Eurorink. I lost that too. I have I have failed on like five wearables this year. So I got to count myself out on that. Do wear a wedding ring lost my wedding ring as well. So that's you know, for bonus points. Dude, I that's why I wear these like $20 rubber ones. Yeah, mine was only a $60 wedding ring anyways. So I didn't feel I mean the sentimental loss.

Yeah, but you know, I kind of knew that. Hey, I don't know if I'm a ring guy. I never wore a ring in my life. Yeah. And sure enough, just taking it on and off ended up I lost mine the first week. Yeah, I lost mine on my honeymoon. The world's best husband. All right. Okay, let me give you a different one. Have we got this shift to media? Great podcast articles, YouTube channels, whatever that we really like. I have a whole category called canceled comedians. I have a whole category called canceled comedians. Which is like there's a whole bunch of people that I love their content.

They're canceled by you know, society, but I love there still they're just as funny as they were before everybody found out that they like, you know, like to have sex with 18 year old girls or whatever. Like so there's this guy, Chris Dillia, who got canceled. I don't know a year ago. I found him really funny before I find him really funny now. And he also has these little like almost like inspirational moments in between the comedy that I love. There's this video he has called life rips. Have you heard this video? No, but I love him.

All he's saying is like, you know, the shit was happening in my day or whatever. And he's like, he has this phrase life rips, which is like he's saying like life is awesome. And he's like, just remember, he's like life rips. And then he he tells the story. It's just in a he's a great storyteller. Amazing storyteller. He tells a story about life rips. It's a feel good moment. It's a reminder that actually, yeah, you're right. Instead of focusing on my problems all day, let me just focus on the fact that life actually really freaking rips.

And and then he brings that in. He brings that as a call back into a bunch of other podcasts that he does where he'll tell a little story. He's like, you know, this is a life rips moment. And just that philosophy has like made me really happy. He does this thing also where some he'll be recording the episode and you'll relate to this. He's he's kind of like, I think a lot of great entrepreneurs and artists are this way where they're like sort of like perfectionists in a way, like they want things to go well.

They want well, well made stuff. And so let's say there's a technical problem where he's like, he's like, let's pull up that clip and then like the computer crashes or like somebody walks by and unplugged his microphone like midway through or whatever, like kicks out the power cord to the lamp. And instead of in that moment getting mad, he just has he just replaced it with this thing where he just goes, yes, the cord ripped out of the wall. He'll just be like something he'll be like, yes, we can't find the file. Or he'll be like, yes, dude.

Yes, we absolutely can't show the thing. I don't talk about yes, nobody has any idea what I'm trying to say. And he just like, instead of being like, oh, no, this sucks, which is like such a pattern that we can fall into. He just does this little yes thing. And I kind of stole it in my daily life. My wife hates it. She thinks it's like very annoying that I do this. Like she doesn't understand what I'm doing. She doesn't know the reference. No, she will. But it was just a podcast either. So she still probably won't.

But it's such a hack, dude. It's such a hack to just instead of just letting this little inconvenience, this little thing that went wrong, f up your mood, just like rewire the response to something that it's almost ironic. It's like sarcastic, but it actually becomes real by the time you do it. Jaco, who's this guy who goes on Joe Rogan, he does the same thing. He's just like, it's crazy. I don't know. Maybe sealed type dude, super hardcore. And his whole thing is around like, you know, pain is good. And so like, he'll be like, you know, oh, you got shin splits.

Good. Like this run. I love that. It gets me fired up. He'll be like, you know, oh, you know, your Uber ride didn't show up. Good. It's like, you know, he replaces of, uh, that sucks. Yeah. Good. Time to, time to get tough or good, you know, good. Got to go earn more money. Lost all mine. Like, you know, whatever. It's like almost comedic how like how extreme he is in it, but not going to lie. This shit actually works. And so that's my, that's my content recommendation. Do you have, um, I've got a, all right, I've got a bunch, but do you have a car, any type of cardio machine at your house? Tremel.

Yeah. And a row. You do have a rower. I have like a light. You have like a rower that makes you feel like you're on the Swiss canal or whatever. I have like a drinky dink, you know, $120 Costco rower. All right. I don't think you're going to want to do this then, but I was going to say tomorrow. So I've been doing, I'll do it on my shitting rower. I've been doing these things where like, I'm like, all right, everyone this Sunday, 60 minute row, poster results. Such a fitness influencer move, motivating others. Do you have a bike? You don't have a bike.

Do you have a bike? I have a bicycle, not like a, not a spin bike. It might be easier if you do in the bike. So I'm going to get up early tomorrow, like seven 30 or maybe seven and I'll get this thing done and just post your results and be like, I just, and so I tweeted out, I go, tomorrow is a 90 minute day. We got to, because, and people are like, isn't that boring? And I'm like, yes, that is the point. We should go through pain tomorrow before we get thankful. So if you want to do it with me, do a 90 minute, any type of 90 minute steady cardio.

I don't think no one there to watch my kids. 90 minute bike ride with Sam. Well, that's what you got to get up early early to do it. You got to like go through some hardship. I don't think you're going to be able to run for 90 minutes, but even like a brisk walk, honestly for 90 could work. But just like, as long as your heart rate's like 140 ish. All right. Let me, let me, let me tell you a five or four. I'm going to go fast on some bits of media. The first, this happened earlier this year.

There's this amazing video of Rose Nambi Unis, this awesome UFC fighter, but the reason she's interesting is she's like really quiet and introspective and seems like a sweetheart, not like a fighter. And there's this amazing video of her about to fight this badass woman from China who just looks like the Terminator and she's repeating to herself. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. And when I first saw that, I teared up. It's the greatest. It pumps me up. It's amazing. The second thing, primitive technology. By the way, can I just give a recommendation there for people who don't follow the UFC, they're going to watch this thing or back, whatever, you know, even if they went and watched it, it wouldn't have the same emotional resonance.

It resonated for you because you know how much of a Terminator that other girls, you know, Rose's backstory and as she struggles with anxiety, she's not a bravado type of person. So for her to say I'm the best, it's not bravado and trash talk. It's literally self talk. So she, you know, can perform, believes it best and not let anxiety get the best of her. So you know the backstory, but I think everybody should have these go tos, these, the stash of like inspiring moments that you were there for that, you know the context, you know the backstory.

And then you could just put them. It's like that flooding thing I was talking about earlier. You could just go back to it and you could instantly get that feeling. And you should just have a well of these, which I like, I think that people should know that. I mean, like successful people, I don't know if people consider me successful or not, but I know that like way more successful people than I do this, but I rely on like, like I'll like read a book about someone who I admire. And I'm like, how would this person react to this situation? Totally.

Like I do that all the time. Or I'm like, sometimes I'll even do it with like UFC fighters. I'm like, this guy just got punched in the face and he got up. Like I can do it. So I like that Rose Namayunas thing. The second thing is primitive technology. Have you heard of primitive technology? No, what's that? Click the link. It's in there. This guy has 10 million subscribers on YouTube in his videos of which there are, how many are there? Maybe 50. You've talked about this guy. He's like a caveman. Yes. So there's maybe only 20 videos and his very first video has 31 million views.

It was six years ago and it's him not talking, not saying a word. He's in the woods and he's building a hut and eventually it works out to build like a proper house. And he does it without saying a word and he does it with only using things that he finds in the woods. No power tools, no nothing. He builds a kiln. He builds a tiled roof hut. So I'm on that video. It starts as he's just pan the camera is just planning at this just a spot on the ground in the middle of the forest.

It's clear like there's nothing here. I'm going to build a little hut here. Now click to the end. Click to the end. He's at the end. Like a clay hut with the fireplace in there with a fireplace and a chimney. Yes. And the whole video he doesn't say a single word. All you do is he's literally his bare hands. Yes. Just building it and then he'll like make like a hammer out of like some he'll make rope and then he'll make a hammer out of rope and a stick or a rock and a stick. Do you know this guy's backstory? Like this guy looks just like everybody I went to Duke with like who is this guy and why does he do this? It's in Australia, I believe, and he owns this land.

And so if you go to his about page, he just it just says where is this? And he goes Queensland, Australia. Do you live in that wild? I don't live in the wild, but I love going out into the land. I live in Queensland. Yeah. And so he doesn't talk much. He doesn't do anything. His channel has gotten one billion views and all he's doing is building like there's another one. I'm watching him make fire just with this. He's just rubbing his hands together like this with a stick in between. He just made a fire while you were talking.

It's so relaxing. It's so awesome. I love it. I love it. Be honest. Do you actually want because I see this. I'm like, this is so cool. And I'll like click through one and then I'll be like, oh, this is just something I'm going to go tell other people about. I don't I would never actually sit here and watch this for 30 minutes. I've watched all of them. Do you have Apple TV? No, I don't. I have Apple TV. My version of TV is YouTube. So first thing when I sit down the couch, I go straight to YouTube and I'll just watch this 30.

This is like that TV show, how stuff's built. Do you remember that? Yeah. But you do in the background or you actually just watch, pay attention to him. Yeah. Maybe I'll like be talking to Sarah or cooking. Yeah. I'm like, oh my God, wait, watch this. Look what he's doing. Yeah. Maybe it's in the background. I mean, do you, I don't actually sit down and really watch TV unless it's a movie or the challenge or the challenge. Okay. So this is amazing. Okay. Primitive technology. All right. Let me keep going. Let me keep going. I'm going to roll.

Okay. The third one, how to be great, just be good repeatedly. This is an article by Steph Smith who works for me. There's two reasons why I love this article. The first, that is one of the best headlines I've ever read. Yes. It is a wonderful headline and she writes this article about how great things rarely are you like trying to be great? It's more so just like being kind of good, but doing it consistently. And in my life, I have found that with this podcast, with a bunch of other stuff, like I'm like, I don't want to do this today.

It's like, all right, fine. I'm going to do it anyway. Even though I know today I'm not going to do a good job of it. I'm just going to get it done. And she does a really good job of articulating why that works. So I love that article. All right. I'm going to keep going. The, the next one, there's this guy who's got a YouTube channel called more plates, more dates. Yeah. I watch this guy. He is amazing. He looks at pro athletes and actors and he, and he's a, I guess he's a, I think he's a doctor.

I don't know what his background is. He sounds like, you know, he's talking about, and he tells you what steroids he thinks different people are on. I watch these and every time I do, I regret so much. I'm like, what a waste of my life I just did. Um, but I, he comes up with my feed and I'm like, Oh, I know that person. Yeah. Are they on steroids? And then like 30 minutes later, I'm like, I cannot believe I've let this be in my brain for the last 30 minutes. What a waste of my brain.

It's interesting though, because they'll explain like the science behind it. He's like, you, he's like, a lot of people think that this athlete is doing EPO. You wouldn't do EPO because the way that your body works is this, this, this and this. And he like, so it's kind of interesting. He goes, but you would do HGH because the way HGH works is it's proven to do. So it's like a science. It's interesting. All right. And then the gossip, but yeah, there's a little bit of science. It's gossip from a person who I believe is reputable, not in having firsthand knowledge of the people, but firsthand knowledge and doping.

And the final thing I found this book, it has two reviews on Amazon. Only two reviews on Amazon. It's amazing. And so apparently they in the four or in the four word, they say that's one of the most popular books in Russia, but I didn't know that and they translated it into English. So these two journalists from the USSR in 1933 made a deal with the US government that they would let them come in and spend three months doing a road trip. And so they saved up a little bit of money. They came here and they bought a camper van and they spent three months traveling America talking to people with nothing to do really just all they just wanted to learn about of America.

And from an outside perspective, they show what makes America special. And it's incredibly fascinating because we take a lot of things for granted and they criticize America. And this is in the 1930s. So this is this point is particularly, particularly true. They criticize like our race relations and things like that. This is like, this is crazy how people treat each other. But there is a lot of good, including they say there's something about Americans that I've never seen ever before, which is they always think that they are going to overcome any adversity and they always are optimistic about like some situation.

And also, oddly, they're friends with their bosses. So like they work together to achieve things and they don't like like their friend. Like you could be friends with your boss and you cannot hate them or want to rob from them. And people are and it's a wonderful book. It's written in the 30s. It's awesome. So that's my book. Oh, it's called a little golden America. Nice. That's great. You've read the whole thing. I've yeah, I'm finishing it up now and I actually posted a link on my Twitter where it's free like a PDF. Okay, cool.

I like that. Okay. I have a couple of quick ones. So a Chrome extension that I'm liking a lot. It's called every day. And it's basically a habit tracker. So so if you go to the website, I think it's called every day. Let me just find the everyday app. I think is the thing. And basically you just say what you want to do. So you're like, oh, I want to like for me, for example, I have morning routine. I have clean lunch, clean dinner. I have workout. I have my gratitude thing and then I have that's it.

And so and then basically what it does is it just lets you create a streak. So you just say, yes, I did it this day. I intentionally skipped it. I'm allowed to skip it or I missed and it just keeps track of your streaks and it creates this awesome green grid of like as you do your habits, you get this really satisfying completion of like your grid being green. It just shows I'm doing the things I said I wanted to do, which for me is it most people is all of the challenge. All of the challenge is not all I don't know what to do.

It's I'm not doing the shit I know I should do. And so this is just, you know, a great tool. And I think it's great because it's Chrome extension. So it's in your face. You don't have to remember to check it. It's every time you open a new tab in your browser, it's going to remind you, oh yeah, I could I dock that out right now? You know, yeah, I could actually just do that right now and I can get it done. So it's a I actually have my own Chrome extension and I've replaced it with this one.

That's how good it is. So, you know, this is one of my one of my favorite. I'm downloading it now. Okay, let me give you a couple other things that I think are really cool. You showed me this camo. It's an app for your iPhone. Now we spent a lot of money and time. You may not be able to tell right now because both not in our main studio or I'm not in my main studio. You're in a different spot. I look good. I don't know you're traveling. No, I'm not traveling. You've been traveling. So we, you know, on different videos, we have different level of quality or whatever.

But we did the we both tried on our own and then we hired people to like, hey, how do we go get that fancy ass blur and like super HD video? It was so hard. And they're like, oh, you got to buy this Canon, which one 50D 40D 60D 70 which which D do I buy? Okay, I'll get this one. Oh, then I need like some kind of cord or like a capture card. How am I going to do that? It's so much of pain about paying the batteries. Oh, but the battery is going to die during the episode.

So you have to actually get a double battery or a dummy battery pain in the ass. So and it's thousands of dollars for the camera itself was like $1500 or something like that. So it's really expensive. And you were like, oh dude, I'm just using this iPhone app called camo that just you just download the app and then it just uses the native iPhone like portrait mode to make your camera look good. And you were like, look, I'm just using my phone. I look just as good as you. I was like, yeah, I'm using the $2000 thing and it's really hard to set up.

Dude, it's sick. It's only 30 bucks. And look, I'm traveling and I just bring this with me because it's my phone. And I was like, oh my God, it's I think it's 40 or 50 bucks. I don't know if it's 30 maybe it's I don't remember. I actually think in the new iOS, it's just this is just baked in actually. I think they I don't think you even need this anymore. But for now, and if I don't if I'm wrong about that iOS, you mean it's coming out soon like in the new iOS, there's going to be part of the native camera.

So you don't need an app to do this, I think you meet but one coming out soon or one out now. I don't know. It's now soon something. So something like that. So but in the meantime, this app camo is kind of amazing. Great business by whoever's doing this and amazing timing because the whole world went remote and everybody wants to look good. So that's definitely one of the best. The analogy we made or someone made is having camo. It's like in the 70s and 80s and 90s when it mattered that you wore a suit having a camo is like showing up in a meeting in a nice suit.

Exactly. Exactly. So so I think that's a great product. Okay, I'm going to give you a YouTube channel so you did more plates more dates hit the binge I've been on is this is like kind of embarrassing almost. It's these old school direct sales seminars. So I'm like, okay, how do I I don't know why I like this. I'm not even doing anything that has direct sales like I'm not a product I sell that's direct sales. I'm not a salesman. I've never been one. But I'm just like fascinated with the art of persuasion and sales.

Which ones. And so so there's a couple that are really good last night. Like for example, I fell asleep last night while listening to it. If you just search Tony Robbins sales rare. And it's like, there's two there's one where he explains how he sold how he got his career started. He doesn't talk about this much. He got his career started selling audio cassettes like music music tapes to people, you know, to people and he would do these like, you know, he'd go and he's like, yeah, like the way we would do it is a woman would reach out to the potential customer.

And they would say we'd love to have you. We'd love to give you a free gift. And we'd love to tell you a little bit about our company and be like free gift. He's like, yeah, it's a free gift. It's usually worth about $100. And we'd love to give it to you and you know, feel if you'd meet with a person and then Tony was that person and he would be like, he would walk through the step by step thing. And he'd be like, I would say this and why am I saying that I'm saying that because blah, blah, blah.

Here's the thing about how people buy. He's like, and he's got his whole philosophy and he even says in this thing. He's like, you know, would I do this now? No, because I feel like it's a little too pushy. But I'm always the type where I want to know what's the real potent shit that works. I want to know the borderline illegal version of sailing and persuasion. And then it's up to me to decide, am I going to keep the knob on level 12 or do I want to turn it down to nine? But I don't want to be a level six because I was too afraid to ever find out what is maximum persuasion look like.

What's the channel called? I just look at the individual videos. I don't have any channel. So like who's Gary Halpert rare or Gary Halpert 1980s or Gary Halpert original seminar. Tony Robbins. Young Tony Robbins rare Tony Robbins original seminar Tony Robbins direct sales Tony Robbins infomercial. And I'll go either I'll just find their material and I'll deconstruct it myself. Like what's working? Like we had Craig Clemens on and Craig Clemens comes on the podcast and he's a friend of ours and he's doesn't he's a great person on the pod. But he doesn't go first. He doesn't talk a lot about his company.

So he's got Golden Hippo. They've sold like over, you know, I think he sold over a billion billion dollars worth of product in his lifetime. And Golden Hippo will do, you know, over a hundred million dollars in sales. But it's like, hey, what Golden Hippo is a holding company? What are the companies underneath? And he doesn't really like go list out the 13 companies or whatever however many there are underneath it. And nobody really pushes him for that. And he's kind of like at the made it stage now. But he's he got to start early on doing sales for a guy who's like a dating coach.

And it was like, I bought that you're dating and like how to how to basically it's all different titles that all mean how to get late. And if it was a wife, I was like, how to get the man of your dreams, how to get a husband, how to whatever. And he and so I find these old interviews or old seminars he did with that guy, Eben Pagan. And I'll go watch those and I'll see. Oh, interesting. He's talking about this headline he wrote and why this headline is amazing and why he thinks it worked and this other one and why it totally didn't work.

And what he learned from that. And I just find these to be like, it's like puppy chow to me. It's just I can't stop consuming it, even though I really have no direct use for it. I just love it. So I'll tell you guys listening. Gary Halbert. So Gary Halbert's this guy. He died somewhat recently from just like a heart attack or something. And he was an amazing copywriter and he might have died in prison or soon after he was in prison. For a handful of years because he sold something. Ironically, that's the guy I want to learn from.

Yes. And the world famous guy took it too far. Like Wolf of Wall Street. I'll go learn from him. I'm not going to take it as far, but I want to learn from that person. I think you went to prison for mail fraud or something like that. So basically people bought stuff and he just didn't fulfill it. And so he was just like, I sold it and I just lied. And that's obviously wrong, but you can learn a lot from him. And he's got these amazing things called the letters from Boron. There's Boron letters. Sorry.

And they're all free. So if you Google Gary Halbert Boron letters, you can find them for free. It's a series of letters that he wrote his son Bond from prison. And he teaches him everything he knows about life and selling. Yes. And so like you can go read it. I wrote them all by hand because I was just so and you're going to read it. You're like, why would you? Why is this so good? It's so good if you know why it's so good. It's almost like that. It's like, it's not. It's clearly good. Like you start.

You fall down like his slippery slope. You're like, why is it so interesting? Why do I want to keep reading this? Exactly. You don't know. It's not like, like it's not a, um, it's what I'll call a door, not a window. So a window opportunity is one where you look right in and you could see what's in it for you. And you're like, oh, okay. Like, for example, let's say you wanted to get better at copywriting. The thing is not called how to get better at copywriting. And he doesn't say, here's five copywriting techniques. No, he actually writes these as letters to his son and then he just does shows you great copywriting.

And then he sprinkles in lessons as he goes, but it doesn't come to like letter five or whatever. There's like, it takes you. You're just interested. You're hooked. And you don't know why. And that's the technique. And then you got to like figure out why is this so damn good? What is it about this writing style that's so slippery that I just can't get it. It's like a tiktok feed. I can't get out of it. You know, and so I would say it's like more like a door where you kind of got to go knock and take a leap of faith that there is something on the other side of this.

You can't see exactly what you're going to get until the door opens. Yeah, this is a winner. All right. Well, I think I think we just like laid out a ton of interesting stuff. Ben, you there? And by the way, we should put links to as much of these as we can in the show notes. I'm also going to send out a newsletter of just like summarizing these just on like whatever my own like my own. Like my weekly newsletter, whatever, SeanPurri.com. And because I think these are actually really good, but most people listening to this is probably really fucking hard to be like, what am I supposed to do? Write these down and go Google all these different things these guys are talking about.

Yeah, we'll do it. You need the links. What do you think, Ben? Yes, it's going to be great at the bottom of the show notes. We'll just put a long list of all the links so people can find everything. But this is awesome. We'll just spew in cool products that we consume. By the way, I have half of you told me about this two minutes or you told me before, but I was busy. I learned about this premise two minutes before the show and I actually still have like five things that we didn't even get to.

And I know you have like 10 things we didn't even get to. So we may want to do, if people like this, we may want to do one more of these. I like it. And the point of this is it's supposed to be Thanksgiving special, right? So you guys are just, if you're fat with turkey, you're sitting on your couch, you got some time on your hands. You can just start clicking through all these links, check out all this stuff, buy some stuff, watch some things, have a good time. I think it's mostly free stuff, by the way that we mentioned.

Yeah, a lot of it is free or very cheap. Ben, I love that sales pitch. I thought that was great. Who's, have you been watching these videos too? Are we sharing YouTube accounts? What's going on? Yeah, I just had to step up my game after you're talking about all this copywriting and sales stuff. That's the Mormon in you. You guys have natural salespeople. You guys are the world's greatest salespeople. I guess. Mormon jokes never get old. No, probably not. Some stereotypes, we have so few stereotypes we're allowed to access these days that when there is one that feels like it's okay.

You just got to hit it over and over again. Good, I'm down. Well, thank you. All right, I'm out. I got to go be with my family. See ya. Happy Thanksgiving. I'll see you guys next time.
