Model: Whisper-small

What up? What's going on? Um, did we ask people to subscribe and unsubscribe? Did that work? I don't think it worked. We got a bunch of videos of people doing it. Thank you for doing it. In my opinion, that experiment doesn't like, uh, it doesn't move the needle too much. I don't, I don't know if that technique is a, is a big technique. Let's answer the podcast keeps growing organically, but we didn't see a spike because we asked people to do it. Let's answer all their questions. Um, you want to answer them today or I think next, uh, Thursday because I didn't have them.

I don't, I got a lot of them. Yeah. The problem and I apologize to people who send me things on Instagram. I don't check that ever. Oh yeah. I didn't know there's two inboxes on Instagram. Yeah. Facebook always does that with their show. I didn't know that that was even a thing and I had all these nice people sending me reviews. You find it like a year later. Yeah. And I didn't even know that. So apologies. Um, I listened back to one of the episodes, which is, uh, the most uber uncomfortable thing you can do.

I've not listened to one ever. Yeah. I don't blame you. I listened back and, um, you know, you're saying you're very self conscious now because we do the video and that's how I am about the audio because I listened to it and I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I talking this fast? Why am I breathing like that? I think, no, I think you have a, you've got to actually have a great voice. I think you have good cadence and someone at one of the meetups asked me, he goes, do you guys cut out silence? And I was like, on the audio we do.

You do. Sean does that. Yeah. Oh, I thought we didn't. And he was like, you guys are talking so fast. Yeah. So he cuts out Ohms, Oz or big repetitions. Like if I say the same thing, two different ways for no reason. Um, and then I think he cuts a little bit of the gap between us when he doesn't like it. He's like a perfection. I told him not to do it because it takes him like six hours to do every time. He's like, it makes a difference. And I was like, I don't know if this shit makes a difference.

I got compliments from it. Okay. All right. Well, he's going to justify it now. That's crazy. I just thought we were talking fast. No, people like the, we do talk fast, but it's the in between where he speeds it up and then he cuts out any like extraneous bullshit. People like it. You know, I also got tons of compliments from stew a few episodes back. People liked him. People like stew. Yeah. High approval rating. People like he doesn't have to drop out of the presidential race like everybody else. All right. What do we got today? Uh, speaking of presidential, did you want to talk about Bernie? Is that what your first thing up here? I have a thing up there, but I didn't research enough, but I'll talk about it just quickly.

So a bunch of people on Twitter were freaking out because Bernie's proposing this tax on vested shares that you haven't actually cashed in yet. Okay. And tech people were like, oh, okay, there goes the startup scene. Like, well, you know, if you're going to tax people on vested shares that they haven't actually received the prop, like this company's not liquid. And so there are some nuances like it's written here. It's tax on non qualified stock options of at least 100,000. You know, if you have over 100,000 in stock stock options that are vested and your employees making at least 130 K.

So it's not everybody. And it's not all types of things. So it's not RSUs. It's ISOs, I believe. Okay. So I'm not an expert in this stuff at all. And I'm not an expert in politics. I know what I believe, but I don't know the technical details. Well, let's agree to talk out of our ass for two minutes. I'm not going to talk about that actually. But here's what I am going to talk about is starting a company and how it worked with us. And this will a lot because I do know that a lot of people think like, Oh, the rich are doing this, they don't understand things.

So when we started the hustle, I saved up $25,000 to start it. With that $25,000, I made 60 grand in profit in six weeks, which is pretty good. And the first year in business was roughly $380,000 in revenue. And most of it was profit because I paid myself. We are in I think we were in LLC. I withdrew $2,000 a month in salary salary. And that's why I paid my bills. My rent was cheap, very cheap, hundreds of hundreds of dollars a month. And I lived off $1,200. Beyond that, beyond that, I lived very, very, very, very frugally.

And then we decided to raise a little bit of money. I raised, I think $300,000 from people at a three and a half million dollar valuation. And you had to change from being an LLC at this point, right? Yep, change to C Corp. An S Corp, I think. Was an S Corp? Probably a C Corp. I don't remember. I see this is I'm not an expert in this. Yeah. You want to be a C Corp if you're going to take investment. That's just like, you don't have to study all the differences between them. But if you're going to take like traditional investment, they're going to want you to be a C Corp.

So we converted. It costs five grand to do that. At this point, we probably had half a million dollars in $300,000 in the bank account. I don't remember. Between 300 and 500,000 by the end of our first year. And we raised money at a three and a half million dollar valuation. And then once we started doing stock options and stuff like that, we signed up to CARTA and they gave us a, what's it called, the 409A? Yep. Where we got that 49A just values your company at some number. So you guys had revenues, so they probably took some standard multiple of revenue.

Yeah. So they valued us. And you want it to be low at this stage. Yeah. So they valued us in the millions of dollars of range. I don't remember. It could have been three and a half. It could have been six. I don't remember the number. Whenever these types of businesses are, that's what they value. And you want it to be low because that's what your share price is. That's what your stock options are going to be. If you're an employee, you want to get in at the sort of low valuation. So when it sells at a high valuation, you get this sort of increase in value.

But if they, if the 409A comes back high, then you're not going to get as much of a lift on your share price. And so at this point, our 409A is many tens of millions, which is nice. That's cool. We have a valuable business. But when we started, it was single digit millions, which was still a lot. I was 24 at the time. I said I started with $25,000 and I was taking $2,000 a month. I was not saving any money. Okay. I'm not complaining because it worked out. But so on paper, I was a millionaire, multiple millionaire.

If I had to pay, I think there, I forget what this, I don't want to like act like I know I'm talking about. Let's say if I had, if I had to pay 20% in taxes on that multiple millions of dollars, I literally wouldn't have had any money to do it. Right. Even if I wanted to withdraw money from our business account, I would have had to lay people off or right. I like so when people say certain people are hoarding money or something like that, a lot of times it's not true. And I have a lot of founder friends that have businesses that are on paper with hundreds of millions of dollars.

Right. And they have tens of thousands of dollars saved. That's a big account. Yeah. So they're not like, yeah, I think people need to. And this also happens if you're an employee, you leave a company, you usually have what they call an exercise window, which might be 30 days, 60 days, 90 days. I think that I think the normal 90 days. So that gives you three months to come up with the money to buy your options or you lose them. Yeah. And a lot of people don't have that money because like, you know, they leave one company, it's a startup and now their shares are worth 80 grand or 180 grand.

And they need to go, they want to go do a different job. And now they need to come up with 80 or 180 grand to buy out their options. That's not still a guarantee that that money's coming back. And often people don't have that money sitting in the bank. So they'll forfeit their options, which is a true bummer. Some companies are being cool about it, Pinterest, a couple others I don't remember, maybe Stripe, they increase their exercise window to seven years or six years. So they're like, look, we know this practice is a little bit crazy.

It's hard to come up with that cash and you worked here, you earned your shares. So we're not going to try to take those back. You have the longer window because we might be private for longer, which is kind of a cool trend. So my company should do that. My W2 income. So at this point, I make money in eight or 10 different ways. I got loads of things that just it just has added up over time. And that's great. And I still pay myself a salary. I pay myself not that much. I'm not the highest paid person here.

Yeah. And I but my W2 salary, we're going to be four years old. I've been working on this as a project since 2014. We're going to be four years old officially in April. I oh, next month, I my W2 salary in year one, I think was $24,000 year two, maybe 36. And then year three, then I started going higher because the business was established. Yeah. But my W2 income historically has been low, right, quite low. And so when I saw this and I saw people getting mad at rich people, I'm like, I bet people thought I was rich.

But I wasn't. You know what I mean? Yeah. And you wouldn't have qualified for this because it says you have to be making at least 130K. But like, but if I had to pay tax on my stock now, it would be painful. Fucking hard. Yeah, you'd be in a really tough spot. So, you know, Bernie, I like Bernie, but this is a little bit crazy. This will really screw up the way the startups ecosystem works. But it can also adapt. I'm not even going to get to stand up. I think it's crazy. You're not. I just am giving a perspective of my business.

And I bet and I think I now I think I have a lot more cash than even most people who have companies that are huge. What's your biggest regret in the way you set up or organized or structured the company? I wish I wouldn't have raised money and I would have just owned it all. And why is that? Because I would be greedier and richer. You didn't end up needing that capital. It's hard to say because it worked. It worked. If I wanted to start fresh again, I would have been able to do it. I can start now.

What about advice? A lot of people think, oh, this person is so successful, right? You raised money from a bunch of cool, smart, successful people either in media or not in media. Yeah, so that was helpful. Was that truly like, so did you get your sort of values worth on the advice component? Yes. Because I'm not sure that that typically plays out that way. But I think it works. Okay, so look, our network is so fucking powerful. Me and you, our network is so powerful. I have, I think, 35 investors ranging from Tim Ferriss, the founders of Nerdwall, which is who knows what that's worth, billions of dollars, the founder of the Chive, founders of Bleacher Report.

Who else? Just look it up. A lot of people. And I text them. I just text them. I'll say you get a lot out of them. I'll tell you two things that you do that gets a lot. First, your investor updates, which you send, you used to send more frequently. Now I send quarterly, but before I for monthly, right? 36 months, I send them every single month, every single month. And it was so well organized. It was basically like, hey, here's all the key metrics. You don't beat around the bush. It's like, this is how much cash we got in the bank.

This is how much we made this month. This is how much the email list grew. This is how much our open rate was. Boom. That's number one. Number two, and what was your second sort of section? The way that I set it up, I was like, I go numbers. I go, here's the numbers. There's no interpretation. All right, let's get into it. Numbers. Boom. Okay, then I go. And then I do things that are going well. Things are not going well. I need your help. Yes or no? Yeah, it was great. And you sent that to, so you did the work to keep them engaged and stay top of mind.

Do not underestimate this if you're doing your business. If there's people who are willing to help you out, you got to find a way to stay top of mind. And part of it is you share frequent updates. And there's a very good sign if you're an investor, if you're one of your companies, stop sending their updates for a bit. That company is about to die or they're on their way to dying and they go into a shell. And Paul Graham has this great post, which is just like, as an investor, when you see that, you know, it's time to go check in.

And as a founder, ironically, that's when you need to help the most. Yeah. So don't go quiet when you need to help the most. That's when you need to be talking and asking. And maybe you actually won't die if you could keep that going. What other mistakes have we made? So I always regretted the, I think that the normal way that people give out equity is a little too founder greedy. So I wish I'd given more equity to my team. And so like, you know, basically, I wish I just negotiated it better between what do I get, what do the investors get, and what does my team get? I think it was in balance.

I think some of what the investors got, the team should have got some of what I had, the team should have got. Because really, like the people who are there as person 456, really, they're taking just as much risk as you are in a way. Like they were there when it wasn't obvious that this was going to work. And so for the All Stars, I wish I had given more. And next time my next company, I'll do just that. I will make sure that core four core five people, I'll make sure it's not like like typically in a company with the pool be so I don't know exactly what the pool be.

But let's say let's go what's typical. So typical company to co founders, you start 5050, you're going to raise some money, they might end up taking 25 to 30% of the company, depending on how it goes, let's call it 25%. And so, you know, as the founders, you you diluted down, you're at I don't know, my math's bad, but let's say you're both at what is that 30 something 35% each now. And so you know, that's where you're at. And then your team, the option pool, they typically say is like 10 to 15% is your sort of option pool.

Yeah. So the first few employees might have like, you know, the key person might get like one to 3%. And then everybody else is below that is below 1% essentially. And I just think that's like a pretty hard skew. So I would try to get multiple people in the sort of one to one to 4% range. I would try to have like my core my core team all be in the over 1% range for sure. And whether that means I take the haircut, or investors take the haircut. That's what I would do if it's a tech company.

I think this is very different if you're not a high growth tech company if you're in San Francisco again, though, I'd start it wherever I live. And so if I'm if I want to live here, yeah, I started here. If I wanted to live somewhere else, I started somewhere else. Now you can start it definitely anywhere. So it's just about your preferences. I if I was going to start again, another thing that I would do is I would go and get a job somewhere and just make like when I started, I hadn't I didn't I was always self employed mostly.

I wish I would have worked somewhere maybe for a little while before you did it or you mean as a do something as a side hustle before you just get the experience. Yeah, I think it would have been nice and save money. That's interesting. I wouldn't have thought you'd say that. I think it would be helpful to understand how things I think if you did it for three months, you'd be like, Okay, I'm done. It would have been nice. I got it. Back some money away. Yeah, that's fair. Hey, it all worked out. You want to talk about some stuff? Yeah, let's talk about some ideas.

Okay. Run the world. I'll start there. Cool. Perfect timing. Perfect timing. So these guys have been working on this obviously before this to I think female founders. And what this is is it's a digital conference. So especially with coronavirus and you've had major major conferences shutting down. So Facebook's F8 conference done. I believe off canceled. I believe GDC is done. You know, like I predict South by Southwest, but this episode will air in a couple of days. I bet you they're going to cancel. Yeah, so tons of these conferences are closing. And I've always this is a great experiment because I've always wondered, why aren't there more digital conferences? Now we built a product called Blab that was sort of like this.

People used it this way, a bunch of podcasters through a conference on our platform. And I just thought, Hey, this is cool because you could be remote. You can be anywhere in the world. You can attend this thing. And what does the conference have? It has speakers. Cool. You can stream that online. No problem. It has like exhibitors. Cool. You could do that online if you want to do it. It has the networking and that's a little bit harder to do online, but you could do that as well. It's missing the biggest component though, which is what serendipity.

Yeah, you have to engineer that serendipity into the product. That's the biggest part. So these guys claim that they sort of have recreated all of that. I don't know. I haven't used it yet. But the cool thing is we're now going to find out because with all these conferences cancelling, Run the World is taking advantage and they're going to all the conferences as they're saying, Hey, hosted on our platform, we make this really easy for you. They have a cool model where basically it's no money in. They just take 25% of the ticket sales. Whose computer is up here? Can you Google Run the World? Yeah, pull it up.

And so they've raised a bunch of money from Andres and Horowitz this week. Yeah, a lot of money. They announced it and it's funny. Henry just Google Run the World and the Beyonce song came up, which is hilarious. My friend had a company called Little Things, which is the is that another song? It's what's the boy band with Harry Styles that was a what are they called five? You could talk Alan. Yeah, Run the World today. Run the World dot today is the URL. So live events worldwide. Anyways, I think this is cool. And we're going to find out if this is like, like they've been dealt the best hand for their product right now.

And we'll see if they can pull this off. That's interesting. Do you think that the like, I think we should do one of these for the listeners. Like just like you do the New York meetup, I think we should just try just to take this for a test drive. I think we should just do an impromptu one and hang out with people, get let everyone meet each other. I'm down. I okay, if we had to make predictions, if this is going to work, so I would say the safe bet. The safe bet's always know the safe bet's always know.

Okay, but if you had $100 million, would you invest $2 million into this business? I don't know who these people are, and I haven't played with the product. So that's the caveat. Let's say I met the people and I played with the product and I felt like they did the thing you said, which is it wasn't just a live stream of content or a chat room, like there was some way to engineer the serendipity of a network of the networking in a conference or the discovery of new products, right? So if I felt like they did something different besides just a teleconference, like live stream, then I would buy it.

But I got to feel the magic. That's a stock photo. So there's a, Henry's pulling up a photo right now of a mug that says hustle. We use that photo. That's from Splash. That. He was looking at it. He thought that they stole it. Henry was writing up a cease and desist like during the podcast. That's great. Okay, run the world. Internet conferences. You're in or out. I am going to say 51% in. Okay. All right. We'll take it. So what here's what we'll do. By the time this airs, I'm going to have set up the run the world conference.

The link to it is going to be in the show notes and we'll figure it out. So go in the show notes right now if you're listening to this and get a ticket to attend our conference and we'll try this out. And then we'll let everyone decide. Is this cool or is this like one of those ideas that sounds good in theory, but it misses the magic and never works. Henry, go to go daddy.com real quick. Pick a URL and we'll send them to that URL as well. I hate going to the show notes. Okay.

Either way, we could just put it on our my first million podcast. My first million. My first million podcast.com. Okay. My first million podcast.com. It will be redirect to this. You want to charge for it? Yeah. Yeah. Tickets will be whatever. I don't know. Pick a number. Okay. We'll make it cheap. 20 bucks and what it will be is what will it be? We'll invite our friends. So we'll invite some of the people that we think are the most interesting. We'll do a talk on, Hey, how do we build, you know, we'll get we'll do the things you do in the conference.

Right. So a couple of speakers up fireside chat and the networking where people can meet each other. Okay. And we'll limit it to 100 people. Yeah. Okay. 100 people. That some amount of money. My first million podcast.com. Yeah. Try it out. All right. So what else we got on the on the agenda? Oh, I have one. Scroll down. You want to talk about some book club stuff? Yeah. Okay. So score on more. Keep on going. If you don't see the notes we use for this is hilarious. One long running Google doc with just bullet points for every possible thing we might talk about.

Yeah, it's great. Okay. So we were going to talk. I was going to talk about this a few weeks ago. Okay. So when I moved to San Francisco, I started a book club called the anti NBA. And I did it because I didn't go to an elite Ivy League school, but I was always envious of those people because when I moved here, I didn't know a single soul. And I felt I always like stereotypical people is like tall, beautiful white teeth with Patagonia's and they had like lovely networks. That's what you saw all around. Yeah.

Just like these like rich white people who that's how I like, right? That's how I imagined it. And it kind of was that. And I was always envious of that. So what I did was I created a book club meeting where we would meet every week and we would read one book a month and I would convince an expert. How'd you convince people to join this? Where'd you throw it up on your blog? Or what? Just a cold email guy. I just learned how to cold email people and I did it online. So each week we would have 30 people show up and I probably had an email list of 5000 people who would.

This was not in person. This is all online. 30 people in person. Yeah. A lot of my best friends. I met this way. 30 people. My friend had an office and let me use it and we would just meet up and I would and I would read a week ahead of time and just make notes and lead discussion. And sometimes we would have an expert. Okay. And then I would send show notes or meeting notes to the list and people loved it. I made close to no money off of it or I don't think I made any money off of it.

I just did it for fun and it was very successful. And a lot of people said that we should make it a thing. I think it's a stupid. I thought it was a stupid idea but book clubs are actually kind of interesting. So there's this business called Book of the Month Club. It was started and I believe it was started in the 1930s. At this point it's owned by it was owned by Bertelsman which is a large publisher, a multi billion dollar publisher and then recently a private individual bought it for single digit millions of dollars.

In the 40s, 50s and 60s this was massive. I mean it was millions of people paid for it. So it was quite a large business. Hundreds of millions of dollars probably in the 60s and 70s. It's gone away once Amazon came around. A guy bought it a couple years ago and it's quite large still and what they do is score down a little bit. This is 90 million users. What the hell? No that's Goodreads. Oh that's Goodreads. And so Book of the Month Club now has 100,000 active paying customers which means they're in the revenue range of 10 to 15 million a year in recurring revenue and the founder said in an interview his goal is to grow 5x a year.

5x a year? Nice. For the next year. Not consistently. I don't know if that's I think that's bogus but Book of the Month is kind of an interesting thing. I suspect I've always thought that it would not work. Now my opinion has changed. So Goodreads has 100 million users. There's this thing called the Wattpad. Have you heard of Wattpad? I've heard of it. Yeah. Wattpad. A lot of people don't know about it. Wattpad it's owned by a guy in Canada and they have 400 employees. It's a multiple 100 million dollar year business I believe. It's a book club for it's not a book club.

It's more So you write on it. You write original stories on it. Yeah but it's their category is middle America romance novels. So if you're a 40 year old woman you probably have heard of Wattpad you're saying that's the most popular category or yeah but it's pretty much all they do. Oh really okay. It's basically for women who it's like men do video porn romance novels is woman porn. I mean that's basically what it is. And so huge business and now I'm quite bullish now on these book clubs. Yeah Reese Witherspoon has a book club.

My wife uses it. My sister so many people have you heard of this. No I haven't heard of that one. Sunshine some fucking thing. Oprah had hers but hers wasn't a paid membership but this is really smart. Like what you're describing I'm like oh this is good. I think you got to have probably not got to have but it's advantageous here to have a brand like a Reese Witherspoon or whoever Jennifer Aniston or Gwyneth Paltrow or whoever or like the hustle could do a book club. You could do a book club like I think that you have to have a bit of cachet to organize people around to get the energy going that initial energy you need.

So here's one angle you buy the rights to the book which is expensive. Yeah why would you do that. Well because I think the margins and books are quite small. I've talked to Tim Ferriss about this. He told me that he earns. He didn't say that he didn't tell me this but he told me I mean I think that he does about a million a month in revenue of his podcast and he told me that this is what he did tell me. He has made 10 times more money off the podcast than all of his books combined.

Right. So I don't think people get paid a lot of money for books. Right. The margins. It might be a cheap asset you're saying. Yeah I think it's quite cheap. So I would want to my goal would be to buy the rights to the book and make it popular. You know who. Have you heard of. There's this company that owns the company that owns proactive. It's called a. I know what you're talking about. It's the skincare. It's a direct marketing company. They the guy who owns it. It's a quite large business. He got his start because he bought the rights to thinking grow rich.

Oh really. And he helped make it popular again. Oh wow. Through infomercials. So that's what I would do is I would want to buy the rights to all the books and there's another company called Mentor Box that does this and Tyler Lopez is one of the owners. So it's incredibly scammy. I mean like you sign up for like $20 and then it rolls into like a $400 a month thing. It's like fucking stupid. But book clubs are super interesting to me. So would you do this. Like if you were going to do this now how would you attack it.

What would you do. So you buy the rights to the by the right. If I wanted to bootstrap it. No you can't how would you do it. So what I would do is I would look at what vinyl me please vinyl me please is my friends business. It's a probably a couple million bucks a month subscription thing. So what you do is you give them $50 a month and they send you a vinyl once a month. Right. And so I would do that but for a particular type of category. So what I would do is I would create a Facebook group and I would say it's $30 or $50 a month and we're going to read one book a month.

I'm going to get one expert to come and talk about the book each week or each month. We're going to do it in a Facebook group and I'm going to send you notes about the whole. And what category do you think you choose. Would you do the romance novel or would you do business or would you do. Well just because I have such a network and business that I could just crush it off the bat. But romance novels I know this from experience because I've invested in these types of things romance novels have the have the highest liquidity as in people consume them the most.

Right. So I would like voracious readers five five times the number of books read romance category is probably one of the most probably the most popular category on Kindle. I bet you it is. So. OK. Personally I would start here. But if I even slightly was interested in romance novels I would. And I like what this guy did buying the rights to the Book of the Month Club for some popular asset that sort of decayed over the last 30 years and see if you can revitalize it on the cheap. I think these are interesting businesses.

There's so many books that I love that are written in the 60s and 70s and you try to buy them on Amazon and they're hundreds of dollars because they've just been forgotten and they don't reprint them. Right. I just try to buy a book the other day for that someone mentioned on Twitter and it was nine hundred dollars. What book. It was. So I just tweeted about Agora that the scammy company which we can talk about if we want. But it was all about copywriting was nine hundred bucks. Wow. OK. Yeah. Let's talk about Agora.

OK. You want to hear about Agora. OK. So Agora is is what it's a B2B paid newsletter company. Yeah. That has absurd revenue. Go to my Twitter account. OK. So here's another interesting company. I know this because I'm in this world and it's directly related to us. Yeah. Just yeah. That's Sam Parr. Yeah. Whatever. That's fine. OK. So Agora. Crazy interesting background. So Agora was started by this guy named Bill Bonner in the 1970s. He was a publisher. He had a magazine about money and investing and things like that. And then he decided to start changing how he did his marketing and he created a newsletter that became quite popular at this point.

You'll see it's the most popular one. No up higher. At this point they make it's rumored to be one and a half to two billion dollars a year. And the way that they do this there it is. They own 20 to 40 different newsletter publishers. And what they do is is they buy a ton of traffic to their funnels their marketing funnels and right off the bat they'll sell you a fifty dollar product. Right. And once you buy that fifty dollar product they now have a large database and email list of qualified buyers who are interested in a particular topic.

And they typically lose money on this first purchase. So let's say that they have a book that's 50 bucks. They'll spend up to two hundred dollars to acquire you. Meaning they'll buy a ton of ads and they'll lose money on you. But they'll make it up because on that they call a back end on the back end they sell you a two thousand dollar paid newsletter. And this company in particular they even sell supplements and shit. Now some people think that they some people love them. And when you own 20 or 40 different brands you're going to have some legitimately great products.

Right. So what's their best product. Money Map Press dot com or yeah Money Map Press. So this is for hedge funds for financial traders. No. Yes. Some financial traders. Their typical audience is white men between 50 and 70 who who who are conservative and believe in like the government's going to come and like take your money. I mean that goes like so I signed up some of their funnels and there was shit like if you go to Breitbart dot com you'll see an ad that says like Nancy Pelosi is coming for your money and things like that.

And you signed up takes you through one of the agorah funnels and it's a five dollar book and then yeah and then you'll go through these funnels. Now let's just get rid of the whole unethical part because you can learn from everyone who cares if it's unethical or ethical. It's fascinating regardless and you can learn from it. What their experts at is copyrighting and everyone in Silicon Valley not everyone but you know you get the point is all about design. It's got to look good. It's got to be aesthetic. Their websites are a blank page with text.

Right. Not just text but like fucking five thousand words and a buy now button at the very bottom. It's fascinating. That is fascinating. And I think you're you know you know that Peter Teal quote where it's like what's something you believe to be true that if you would agree with you on. Yeah. I feel like you know you might have many but one of them would be copyrighting over design any day. Copywriting over design 100% and most people I remember when I learned the word copyrighting. So I was like what is what is copy. Why does everyone keep saying this.

And like I literally was at work and people like hey can you give me some copy. I was a copy. She just asked me to go get a copy for her. Like I had no idea what the fuck she was talking about. And and then I sort of learned oh copy means text that's going to go on the website. And then through you I realized hey wait a minute the text that's on your website is essentially your salesman and sales gives you the money. I should probably learn how to do this. I went deep on it.

It's the most important skill you can learn because I've spent years learning it. If you just give me a blank page page I will I will make money till I die. Right. I will always have a job because I can do that. Right. Now what I could do is do really unethical shit and scam a lot of people really easily. But if you know how to copyright or you know how to persuade via the written word. Yeah I would say persuasion is the most important skill whether it's through the written word verbally. You know I don't know if there's some other.

Yeah but copyrighting is just the form in which you learn it. Now the way that I describe it is if you're a good copywriter you understand what motivates people and if you understand what motivates people you can create products that they'll want. That will appeal to people. Yeah. And then if you are that is that's so when you do copyrighting you just learn what motivates people and then you just happen to use the written word to communicate. Yeah. When when you mentioned the boron letters and then I just went deep on that that was like my foray into this.

So we'll do a whole section on did you read the board. Yes. And then I started like doing all the things in it because I got obsessed. So the boron letters if anyone's curious Gary Halbert is his name. He's dead now. He died of a hard it's actually kind of hard to find. It's hard to find. But there's there's one link and if you get to it it's like chapter one two three and it gets to 19 or whatever. It's this copywriter who's one of the best copywriters of all time and what he would do is he was such a good copywriter that he kind of turned into a crook and so he would write these sales letters to buy like encyclopedias or and buy like fucking anything just shit.

So the boron letters are the way it starts. It's like he's writing to his son. He's in jail. He's in jail writing to his son and he doesn't start off by being like here's how you copyright. He's just writing to his son and it's one by one and each one's a teaser. Every sentence teases the next sentence and every letter teases the next letter and then by the time you get 20 deep you're like this guy's a master. It is awesome. So read that. All right. What do you guys want a couple others. Okay. So here's an idea.

So I was talking to my cousin and so we were talking about like one of my cousins he's young. He goes on dates uses the apps boom boom boom and then like our aunts and uncles are always like oh my god. Look at him. He's just swiping left and right. He goes on dates. It's like really foreign concept to them and so that was one data point. Okay. Just kind of noticed. Wow. My aunts and uncles they really don't get it when it comes to this online dating thing. Data point to I'm watching the debate and it was I watched so much shit online that when I watched traditional TV first of all it's so slow and secondly I start to see the commercials and I'm like oh this is what's being advertised to mainstream America like cars very fascinating.

So like noom was on there which is like the diet like nutrition plan thing. Yeah. They do really really well and we should break them down later. They advertise but the other one was some it was this gray haired woman comes on the on the screen and she's like oh online dating where do I start and then it's like well open up your browser type www.nmurl it's like and then start clicking around like that was literally that was the ad was like how do I even get started like here's how you get started online dating.

I don't remember the name. Oh come on. It wasn't like a match or you know I'd never heard of it before. So I started thinking and I was like you know there's so many people that are sort of in my sort of extended family and whatnot that are divorced and they're alone and so I was thinking about them. I was like you know it'd be great if they found someone but the reality is they don't do a lot of online dating because it's so scary and foreign and it's not the online part that's scary. It's the expectation that you then need to go meet somebody and so like let's take my uncle for example my uncle's I don't know 65 years old.

He is divorced. He gets lonely as kids are all grown up. Everyone left the house and you know he doesn't want to actually like it'd be great if he met somebody who was awesome and they could just like be companions for the rest of their life but he's sort of like dude I don't want to get out there like last time I went on a date was 40 years ago like I think I'm just out of the game. It's easier to be lonely than it is to put yourself out there. So anyway long preamble for the idea.

The idea is a service that's for older people. Let's make it just 50 and up as a rule and it's called just talking and the expectation is you're going to go on here with other people who are like you or sort of single might be alone looking for companionship but it's just talking. You can't meet. It's not their real names. It's nothing. It's just somebody you could log onto the computer and just talk to either through audio or text and you could talk to them continuously or you could switch and pick somebody else and talk to them but it's just companionship as a service and it's not dating.

You're not going to start going out with this person. You're not trying to get remarried. You're just getting the reps in. You just don't want to be lonely at home anymore and honestly you can have a virtual relationship through this and it's because I was also watching Love is Blind. So and I was like dude somebody should make an app that's just this now off the back of the show. And so anyways these are some ideas. Let's learn about it by I love it. I love it. That's a winner. What I would do is I would go and do research on the sex hotlines that you do exist that probably don't exist anymore.

Right. And I would want to learn how they work. I bet they crushed. So I'll shout out some like tangentially related sex hotline related but obviously master P you so one sex that killed it. Then there's one a startup out here in San Francisco called Papa. Have you heard of this Papa. Yeah. Papa is grandkids as a service. So it's just young people that you that will just come over to your grandparents house and just do stuff for them and like talk to them but like also do their laundry and like take out that trash.

Well I don't know if they're doing well or not. They just launched a bunch of money and because there's this huge aging population of the baby boomers and so there's this wealth of opportunities that are for this the largest generation of people ever in America is now getting old. And I forgot this woman was calling it the the the gray new world and you know for gray hair. And so she's like you know the gray new world opens up all these possibilities. So one is Papa which is grandkids as a service. One is honor because I know honor.

There's a huge shortage of caretakers for for the elderly and so honor is a on demand caretaker platform that you know is but you're getting off track here. Are you going with caring for old people or helping people get laid. I'm talking about just talking. That's my idea. But I was just tangentially saying there's some other businesses that are trying to help relationship hero. What did they do. Never heard of that. No. Jack invested in it and he says it's going well. It's called a relationship here. Relationship here.com and they teach you how to do online dating.

OK. Just coaching for online dating. Can you go to that. That's how it started as it might be a little bit different. This would be for younger people though. It'd be for whoever. I think it could be. I think if you did just talking and you ran a bunch of Facebook ads you could get a lot of people to pay to be a part of a community of people where they can have these online relationships. I love it. Expectation is you do not go offline. I think it's great. You know why I think it's great is because the way the way that you're positioning it is as a marketplace.

Those are notoriously hard to make. But once you have them they're great. Yeah. The reason why I like this is you can kind of fake it at first. Yeah. So you can just hire people. You can have some operators. Yeah. That are that are providing that. I think it's a great idea. You could seed the marketplace with the operators. Yeah. I think it's awesome. We talked about only fans. Yeah. That's trending today on Twitter. Is it worldwide because of what some she must have gone down. I didn't get the joke. I clicked on it and tried to understand it and I didn't write.

I didn't get it. One out of three Twitter trends. Yeah. It was a top only fans which we talked about only fans. Great business. But I love just talking. I think I think that's a great idea. Thank you. Thank you very much. No. I think that's that's a winner. All right. I have a question for you now. So before last week I think maybe it was when I was with Stu but I I shared this anecdote or this this sort of advice which was if you're offered a seat on a rocket ship you know don't ask which seat just sit out and buckle up and this is just career advice which is if you're not going to start your own company you flag for today.

Yeah. I thought people loved it. What do you mean. Well what was the criticism. Nice size audience. Not everyone's going to be happy but what was what was the criticism based on. It wasn't even controversial. Just stuff like titles. It was just comments like people saying titles are important. How much you get paid is more important. Things like that. That's crazy. Disagree. Hard disagree. Okay. So anyways the question was sort of that led to a different question which is what are the rocket ships of today. And so somebody by the way took that idea and made a rocket ship newsletter for jobs or whatever Johnson but beyond that I was just sort of thinking just my thought experiment.

Just my thought experiment. What companies that today are worth one to five billion do I believe will be multi hundred billion. So what's just as a way of phrasing it simpler. What five billion dollar companies today could become a five hundred billion dollar company in the future. I say this because we have friends who bought Facebook secondary stock back in 2006 2007 when Facebook was valued at over a billion dollars and today Facebook's like whatever five hundred billion dollar company and that you know it was clear it wasn't going to zero. It was clear it was a thing and the question but you could have invested then and got a phenomenal return and I have several friends who did I had a friend Alex.

Oh no sorry Josh Buckley who's a good guy founder and British guy. Yeah he's a British guy. And so he he was telling me we were just hanging out one day and he's like yeah I'm buying secondary stock of stripe as much as I can get. And I was like oh like what do you mean. Like I'm not doing that. Why are you doing that. I should do that. And he was like yeah I just think stripes a great company and there's secondary stock available and I'm just buying it. I'm like well what's the valuation.

It's already like a two billion dollar company. He's like yeah but it's like stripes gonna be big. He's like I think stripes gonna be huge. So I'm just buying up secondary and now so stripes value now like 20 billion dollars. So he took essentially like a no risk bet in my opinion and 10 X his money on a private company that was it was already a unicorn but wasn't yet on the stock market wasn't doing like 10 percent a year. You know that's a 10 X appreciation. So long story short what companies do you think have that potential that are in the single digit billions today or less that you think could be a Facebook Google Amazon of our generation.

So a few years ago I answered this question and I thought it was Atlassian and I went in on that and it worked. Okay. Tell me about that. What do you mean it worked. Back then it was. Can you just look at look go ahead and really go to Atlassian stock. We're busy today. I invested in Atlassian stock. I mean it's not like I like yeah I'd Atlassian spoke with an AT. There it is. Yeah and then go to all time. I bought at last Max on the far right. I bought it when it went public.

So what did it go up by. It's like a three X already. So I three X my money. So I bought Atlassian because I read their annual report and I was like oh these guys are great. So their market cap is now 35 billion. Yeah. So I bought it right when it went out. So that worked out well. What do you think it gets to the over 100 billion because very hard to get over 100 billion. How many companies are worth over 100 billion like very very few especially if you think about tech companies. So some of the tech companies that made it Amazon made it Google made it Microsoft made it Facebook made it Uber did not quite make it yet but it's getting there.

Tesla made it like I think I invested in Tesla when it was at about this number five five to eight billion. Oh really. And now it's almost 100 billion. And so like that's a big lift of a company that it's out there. It's not a seed seed startup you're taking a bet on. Right. It's a company that's out there. And the other way to take the bet on it even if you're not an investor is to go work at one of these companies. Right. So like Airbnb was a good candidate. Now it's value too high to qualify for this.

Airbnb is like that. I don't know 35 billion or something like that. We'll see what happens with this. But it's not in the single digit billions anymore. But when we when we moved to San Francisco we could have done that right. When I moved to San Francisco you had a job offered Airbnb when it was worth a billion. One billion. Maybe less. I don't know. There's only. No it was less. It was 2012. Right. So even so let's just say it was at a billion which it wasn't. But let's say it was. Yeah. I would have made $10 million.

So it's 35 X. So even if you had just gotten a sort of standard stock package which was like over four years you're going to get 200 grand. I would have made five or $10 million. Yeah. That's insane. And I got fired before I even showed up to work. So some other candidates that I put up here Flexport I think is a candidate. Maybe. Oh you got some inside Intel. That sounded like a juicy maybe. Well Ryan told me he thinks it's going to be massive or it's going to go bankrupt. Which is like how you're going to be when you're.

That's how you're going to be. That's how you're going to be. So some other some of this was harder than I thought. I also tweeted this out. So the most popular answers I got was air table and Carter and I pretty much disagree with both of those. I don't know. I and I asked these are smart people replying and I was like Carter why Carter. We should get Carter to sponsor this podcast by the way. Yeah. Why are they not. I don't know. You guys need a sponsor and I'm going to I don't give a fuck if people sponsor.

I'm going to tell you the truth. Carter it's the best option out there but it still needs a lot to improve. Right. I use it. I give you guys five grand a year. I'm happy that I give you the money but it can improve. Yeah. So air table air table it would have to basically replace Excel in the corporate world for it to do this. Otherwise it will not be a hundred billion dollar company. How about gusto. Gusto is a good one. So I think there's a lot that are in the sort of either HR tech just you need to be in huge spaces like gusto and rippling.

Yeah. Gusto rippling I think I would be a hundred billion. It's a high bar but yeah. So other ones that I put up here so Stripe but it's past this point. So Coinbase only if the Bitcoin if Bitcoin actually becomes like a Bitcoin actually is the thing it becomes the global reserve currency then well it doesn't have the largest Bitcoin sort of company. The large Bitcoin brand would be I think it just has to become Bank of America and become Wells Fargo. Yeah. I think Bitcoin has to become that relevant for Coinbase to be. Yeah.

I buy that. Open doors. Another one just because residential real estate is so big. So if they actually have a working model they could become a hundred billion dollar company. I don't buy that because what because Zillow and truly aren't that huge. They don't do what these guys do though. Zillow and truly they sell leads to brokers. They're now trying to copy open doors and now they offer what open door offers but open doors literally buying and selling the houses. They're flipping houses at scale which is pretty crazy. What else. This was tough. I don't know.

That's all I had but I put this on here. I wasn't going to talk about it initially but I'm like I want to bring this up. I want people to tell me what I'm wrong about. What companies I should be considering in this but I think it's a really important question because for me I'm going to go try to buy secondary stock in all these companies. OK. So I don't and if you're working you should go work at one of these companies. A hundred billion is that's impossible. I won't even I'm not even going to try to predict that because like only like a few hundred people a few a few hundred businesses have ever probably done that.

I don't know the number but that's really hard to say. But if I had to make a prediction I do think that there will be some new search engines and I also think that some of the new Chrome replacements could be quite large. So Brave is one of them. What's another one. Replacing the browser. Yeah. Anything that are replacing browsers I think are kind of cool and could potentially be that big. I think there's going to be a lot of browser. I think if any company nails AR they will they will be able to do this.

But that's a ways away I believe. How about a Zeus. That was the Zeus self driving car company. Yeah. Yeah. So that was the other I considered all the self driving car companies because I'm like if if one of them becomes a success a self a successful self driving car company the market leader will be worth over a hundred billion. It's just more likely I believe is more likely to be Tesla or one of the incumbents rather they'll buy one of these companies rather than that company independently going from where it is today which is one billion to a hundred billion.

How about this. What companies are public now that could grow that much. So I was talking to Moise the other day and we were looking at stamps dot com. They were crazy undervalued and the next day we were like let's buy this the next day we didn't buy in time. It went up 50 percent went up 50 percent. It was coincidental. Just saw interesting stat over the last 10 years. If you had just bought the Fang companies Facebook Amazon Apple Google in the 10 years it outperformed all VCs or sorry it outperformed even this sort of top like expected returns of venture capital.

So the public market if you just bought the five most popular tech stocks you did better. It was a 20 24 percent IRR over 10 years. OK. Well what what's public now that could I don't fucking know. That's a great question. It's that's hard. You got to really bet on industries. What do you got. Sports betting. Good. That's a good. That's a good. And if the legislation keeps opening up that's a good call. I would do sports betting. I would bet on that industry. That's a great call. OK. We ventured off into stock tips so I want to get back because we don't know shit about the stock market.

That's not our that's not our promise. Let's tell them something else that we find interesting. What else you got. You want to do one more. I'll mention one of the cool company that's related to stocks actually public comps dot com so public comps. Yeah. He's just breaking down S1s for companies which like a lot of people like to do nowadays but it's just a good you don't have to do the research. This guy does the research for you and he publishes it. I like it. Let's do. Let's do. Let's wrap up with made renovation. You talked about this in one of our very first podcast.

Exactly. So one of our very first ones was like hey I saw this ad. I think this is awesome idea. What it is if you don't remember because you're not a diehard. The what it was is it's a turnkey bathroom renovation. So if you want your bad. So the ad was just a dope looking bathroom and it was like if you want this bathroom it's like five grand and you don't have to like because what happens today you have to hire a contractor. You have to come up with the vision board of what you want to be.

You have to choose all these different materials that he sources it and then it turns out and then it's like that's a one off. So they have like four designs of bathrooms. You pick which one you want. You want the old Victorian cool looking one. You want the modern one or you want the middle of the road one. Yeah. I always said I wish I was here's the price and you just push the button. Yes. It's like actually some barbers do this. You go up on the hair. I'll take the number three large. You know no problem.

So that's what these guys are doing for bathrooms. I thought that was really smart. So it turns out this was not just like some random startup. This is Roger Dickey was starting this and he's a he started gigster. He's he's done some cool stuff in Silicon Valley before. So he's not a sort of Joker and they raised nine million bucks and they came out of stealth and I was like I gave myself a little pat on the back. That's a good one. That's a good call. That's a pretty good call. I still think it's a very cool idea and I also think that anybody could compete with them because this will not be winner take all because you have to be doing local role renovations.

Look at that happen. They announced it this week. Good job. Yeah. Can I give myself a pat on the back. Yeah. One of my first angel investments Lucy Lucy Nicotine.com I think or I don't even know what the URL is to be honest. You explain what it is. People don't know. Yeah. So I invested in all your what all your friends are buying Lucy. Oh fuck yeah. Money the bank. Yeah. So one of my first angel investments. I don't remember when this was three years ago. The founder of Soylent Dave who's my friend Dave Runtell Runtell.

He started this thing and it was based. It's basically a Nicarat. So it's right. New Age Nicarat. Nicotine gum. And he told me about it and I was like all right well Dave you started Soylent. So you're pretty smart. You scaled that thing up. I knew him well. He's a good guy and it's a big market. It's nicotine. So I'm like OK. Well I mean this is retention is going to be good. Yeah. I'm a I'm a nicotine user. I like the gum. I chew the gum and I like to chew Nicarat. Yeah. I like to I prefer Losingers.

So I'll put them in my mouth. OK. And you don't smoke. So you just do this. Just nicotine. I like nicotine. It's I don't drink and I don't smoke. It's it's my that's my vice and and it's a monthly subscription. Yeah. I was like yeah of course you'll fucking knock that one off the park. Really smart. And they just raised a lot more money and so on paper which is completely useless on paper is not going to buy me a house or pay my rent but the valuation went up significantly. So I got a little like corner store guy has it at the front by the register and I said OK whatever is at the front by the register.

That's what's selling. That's what this guy is. We'll make him money. Is it really. I sent Dave a picture. I was like no shit. Henry although the guy the guy at the I asked him I said how well does this sell. He's like it's pretty good. It's not dual but it's pretty good. Of course it's not dual. Are the kids are buying Nick Lucy. Oh fuck yeah. Congratulations. Yeah. Pay the taxes on it. Oh fuck. Money in the bank. I think that's a five or six X so far. I'm proud that that would be a that's a good investment.

I like that one. That would be a good one. I think we're one of the first folks in on that one. Fucking I hope it works. And just for the while it is awesome. I it's totally luck. So I'm not gonna take that much credit but awesome. All right. You want to talk about anything else. No I think we're good. I think we're good. Let's save it. We're going to do another one in two days. I got some other stuff for that. All right. Thank you. Give us a review and share with your friends. Yeah.

Tell your friends. See you.
