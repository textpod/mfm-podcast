Model: Whisper-small

Is that what they do that's what they do all right we're back Before we get it so you know how I said leave reviews. Yeah, I think we got two or three or hundred reviews off of that Yeah, it's crazy and we promise about people cool shit. We got to like fulfill because of people like I've been here's my receipt I left you guys a good I got about a hundred messages of people with the reviews I replied to all of them last night. I was sitting on my couch. So I'm just the asshole didn't I see see you I replied to all of them with the special gift.

I just let I Yeah, call them and basically that's great video voicemail, you know at YC They have this thing which is like you'd rather have a thousand people love you than a million people just kind of like you Yeah, and I think that's the one thing that that is now abundantly clear about this podcast It's like we have these goals of like we're gonna grow this thing big But we already did the hard part which is you get a small number of people to love you where they're like This is my routine. This is my favorite podcast and I've been listening to podcasts for five years Yeah, and so that's very I don't know feels good feels great.

Yeah, I had I got I was shown Adam last night. I got I Don't know. I mean at least a couple hundred Like DM's on my Twitter people with the review and I said them all video So review us a little video Review us and let me know because Sean hasn't been doing it But at least if you let me know you'll get something back. All right, you know, what's my fear in all this though? So I have a fear that's crept up now the fear is I Never want to be the smart person in the room and so there's part of me I'm sitting in this red fucking throne and Throwing out ideas that I'm admittedly saying are half baked.

You know probably bad ideas, but they're interesting to me I Want to make sure that we're learning doing this like I want to be learning stuff and sharing it I don't want to just be sitting here saying hey, I got answers I'm gonna give them to you and so my commitment to myself really more than anybody else But I want to say it out loud because that commits me is You know as we do this it's not about oh, I have great ideas Let me say them or or we're brainstorming great ideas It's we're gonna learn interesting stuff by talking interesting people and doing research on things and then we're gonna share what we like We're gonna share what's what's interesting to us So that's my fear is you never want to be the guru you want to be the student And so that's kind of my my little mini rant.

I agree. I'm not trying to be a guru and I'm certainly not Because some of the DMs we get people are like Help me. Yeah, help me. You know I'm like no no. I don't know anything and Me attaching my name to your thing does nothing like we've got to do the work. Yeah, and like you know, I'll help you But I'm not the answer. I don't know. Yeah, I'm not the answer And we could preface this by saying most of the ideas we get I just steal from other people. Yeah, for sure, of course All right, you want to get in what do we want to talk about you want to talk about Can I talk about something that's happening recently? Yeah, Brandless.

So is that what you want to talk about? I'm gonna talk about Brandless and I want to talk about These new credit cards that are popping up. Yep. All right pick one. Let's do it. You go ahead Brandless All right, so Brandless people don't know they went out of business what they were trying to do was They were like look don't pay for the name brand you should just have high quality products and they should just be brandless and Because we take away the name brand we can lower the price That was like the initial promise or the premise of the business awesome idea awesome idea I'm glad you said that because a lot of people are shitting on them now because they like failed But I still think fucking awesome idea and actually of course ironically Brandless is a good brand And so I think that that was really cool.

They raised a shit ton of money from SoftBank like 200 million dollars before they really achieved Any product market fit and that sort of like was the death net for the company because it was just the expectations when you raise 200 million is You're gonna be you know a billion dollar plus company And if you do that too early and you haven't actually proven out your model you haven't figured it all out Expectations crush the business. I actually so I didn't prepare because I just thought about this But what do you what's the biggest grocery store chain in America? You think? Albertans maybe you safe way.

I don't know. Okay. Let's do safe way. Can you look up? Try and find this just just a headline Try and tell me what the revenue or how many sales like Generic brands for grocery stores or like the Kirkland brand or whatever how much revenue the Kirkland brand does Well, I mean, I bet you it's astronomical and so actually I mean if you think about what brand list could become it is the generic The the generic a trusted Kirkland brand. Yeah, I think and I think it's a great idea. Yeah The problem was that they raised all that money right off the bat.

I have a problem. There was some Incompetence with leadership. I don't actually know this. Yeah Kirkland brand sells 39 billion dollars of products Henry quick with the trigger I like that source What's the story you think he's lying you think he's making this up Wow 38 billion dollars in one year so so one thing I loved is I Okay, and that's just Kirkland Kirkland crazy so I listened to her on a podcast Tina Sharky, I think his name and she's like an internet OG. She'd been around with a bunch of companies all of which I think have not done super great, but She went on this podcast.

She said this thing that I liked which was she was like think back to when you were A child and like let's walk from room to room. You're in the laundry room What brand are you gonna see you're gonna see whatever? Yeah tied you're gonna see whatever go to the pantry What are you gonna see you're gonna see fruit roll up and Pop tarts and all this stuff and then open up your fridge. What are you gonna see and you see these brands and Actually, it's kind of like you've seen these stats where the S&P 500 turns over like I don't know 20% of the S&P 500 turns over every every decade Basically the same thing happens with these like household brands these brands that seem like staples of your home, right? A lot of them are like like minute made.

It's like fuck minute made you're out like you know now, you know We're a tang yeah tang, you know like these brands just like something like they are not they can come and go Generationally they don't all make it from one mom to the next mom And I actually believe that premise and she was like look the moms of this generation They don't want to pay for this like the consumer package good brand in the same way They want to know it's high quality ingredients sourced, you know, ethically and you know, they don't want to overpay They want to be you know value conscious.

So I liked a lot of the premise. I'm sad it didn't work But somebody I believe I believe you should just go out today and pitch I'm brandless without soft bank and I think I would I would invest in credible entrepreneur I agree with you I think I had three people reach out to me that said hey, can you ask can you introduce me to the people who are selling? Brandless, I mean, I don't know them But I just tweeted it and I got an intro and I introduced three different people who are wanting to buy The assets and what are the assets? What are you getting you get the name? Maybe a little some inventory probably okay the name and list and then Unfortunately, probably a bunch of incompetent team, right? No disrespect, but look if they couldn't pull it off there by definition well You'll you'll need to restart for sure right you'll need a clean slate and you need to lower the burn.

Yeah I Think it's cool. I would probably charge a map. Do they do membership? They did a subscription because they started off with everything was three bucks. I forgot to mention that that was like a key selling point It's like do not think that's three bucks like three dollar store and people say the cat was too high They cost too much to acquire customers. That's probably true, but like wishes doing it Yeah, you know, I don't know the economics, but this brings up an interesting half baked idea We got a DM from your friend about like businesses that are in the spot brandless as in where they're doing essentially a closed down Slash fire sale and you want to share the idea that that we went Narendra.

Oh, this good idea this morning Yeah, that was a great idea. Okay, so we actually should bring this guy in I have an investor and a good friend of mine I called the mother and we became friends he invested He started a company called web shots and I think he sold it for 80 million dollars and then he bought it back Yeah, if those guys committed you can bring him in he bought it back for pennies and then sold it again for 20 or 30 million dollars and then now has bought it back again And he was like you guys are you know what something would be interesting is if you could be like a graveyard or an unwinding service Undertaker you're gonna undertaker Where you can just buy these dying things and that exists It's a service to basically wind down your company you take a fee and you do the sort of fire sale And I'm sure there's services out there like this, but somebody could specialize in tech companies wind down Both you have talent you have hardware You have you know assets that you're trying to fire sale off and then you have all the normal business closing stuff You got to do so you don't get like taxes next year Because you have to actually shut down your company officially and nobody wants to do that It's not fun and investors want to make sure that that process is done with no like funny business So that they like maximize the value and this kind of reminds me of something that I wanted to bring up Which is I think that now that Private companies are staying private for long and not going public as much what I think needs to happen is I think the venture capitalists a Lot of VC firms need to start buying companies and just need to own them for the cash flow versus Wanting something to go public or get bought and so what I think is going to happen is I think a lot of these VC firms are almost going to turn into hedge funds or private equity funds we're gonna start they're gonna buy and operate a lot more than they are now and That's related to that So I don't think VCs will do it But the sort of new age VCs that are gonna be hybrids so like Andries and Horowitz shifted their model whether not a VC.

They're now I forgot what it's called But like they wanted to be able to just own cryptocurrency is buy and hold it and yeah, so they needed to reclassify and then This guy Chimoth He basically has a fund called social capital it started off as a traditional VC fund and then like he had to restart it for all kinds of reasons But one of the things he does now is he has this thing called a SPAC Which is his special purpose vehicle for taking companies public So you're a company you don't want to go public.

He's already public and he just acquires a stick You know a stake in your company. I believe is that was how the mechanics work So they just did this with Virgin Galactic and so it's like a fast track to being public and getting that liquidity Without having to go and be you know your own independent listing. Yeah, I'm into that I know Andrew Wilkinson is probably listening he owns tiny Capital and they do they've been doing this at the companies that they own collectively I think do about a hundred million in revenue and he I think takes dividends and buys companies with the cash flow, right? And it's an awesome model But a lot of these companies like brand list.

There's no cash flow, right? It's gonna be a cash sink It's one of these go big or go to zero and in this in this case it went to zero. Yeah, but it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be but It's also that is also valid right like to do the do what like jet tried to do which is like, you know They never made their core business work sold for three billion dollars Because they they went for the plow money in today try to get the scale and then be the first to have scale doing what we do I know it's a it's a model What's the other one you want to talk about credit cards? We can mention it just for a second, but Ramp ramp capital right ramp.

Let's ramp something It's based out of New York's Brex but from New York. Yeah, I'm into it. It launched today. Okay, so I went my company We do let's say eight figures a year in revenue we have not seven figures in cash Why have been using one big bank for a long time and To get us to raise our credit card limit from 30,000 to 80,000 was a nightmare. Oh my god a nightmare Yeah, I had to go meet them in person two or three times I had to show them my personal Sam Parr's tax returns It was stupid.

I signed up to Brex and I got three or four hundred that some hundreds of thousands of dollars in like 12 hours Yeah, awesome, and I told these guys and like yeah, we can't compete with that They basically admitted it and I go, okay. Well, this conversation is over. Thank you So I really like this new business credit card space and I'll explain how I think they're making money But ramp just launched and what they're gonna do What they said they're gonna do is they're gonna analyze all your credit card spending and they'll tell you where repetitive purchases are coming through and I actually mentioned this on the podcast Three months ago.

I was like I'm telling you that Businesses are wasting so much money by buying multiple subscriptions of things and I think something amazing can be built by helping you save a little bit of money Right, that's what this is That's like a side feature they have that's not the main feature is the same like Brex, right? It's like here's a business credit card. Well, that's how they're differentiating Brex's Advertising says we will get you better rewards, right and this is will save your money Yeah, and I think it's cool, and I'm really bullish on those things and I think the way they work is whenever whenever a customer When I have my credit card and I go and buy something the merchant pays a 4% fee and What Brex does is they go to Mastercard and they go hey you guys are getting 4% fee for all this stuff give us a cut of that and we'll create more credit card users, right and I think that's how they're making money out of magic.

I think so. I don't know. I don't know for certain but FinTech companies are very interesting We should I know a couple guys are deep in FinTech will bring them on a lot of people are not Deep into that and a lot of go like well front and betterment a lot of people hate those like buyers, right? I don't know how they're ever gonna get bought. I don't know who would buy them We'll see. All right. What else we got up here. Let's see. I feel like Shawn when we come through the last few times I've been the one doing all the research and I have a feeling that you're the one who's done all the research I did some research this time.

So first follow up on last time. I was talking about corporate universities I'm gonna keep talking about anything education because I just love it. I had a lot of people reach out to me about that Really, okay, so I went back to my notes. I already had these notes, but I just wanted to mention a couple of them So hamburger you that's the McDonald's one 19 full time professors. I thought that was interesting There's I don't know how you say this Crotonville. That's from General Electric So Kaiser just opened up their own med school, which I find really interesting because it's what that's exactly what I was talking about Where you want your own pipeline of doctors? So you create your own med school? Then some companies do it more like training Apple University Deloitte University I think those are more like just a training program so you could be a better employee.

That's that's different bigger Another one that I thought was interesting So we talked about Zoho so Zoho has their own university and the graduates of that make up 15% of their workforce Which is pretty insane so hundred they have about a thousand maybe they have more than a thousand people I'm not sure exactly how many total that is The Google IT support certificate has seventy five thousand Graduated students, which is pretty crazy. So I think this is gonna be a big trend So where's the opportunity to be a company that can create these education? So I think what you can do is so there's these companies that are called What the hell are they called? I know one is called to you or something like that That's the name of one of their companies So there's a set of companies that what they're doing is they say hey university.

Hey Berkeley you should have an online degree and For years universities were not so interested in this and then they saw how much money gets made by online degrees And so they're like okay, we'll take that money And so they don't want to you know Berkeley doesn't want to have to sit there and build out an online degree portal that has like the technology the service acquire students Like Berkeley doesn't know how to do any of that shit, right? So these there's a couple there's three big companies that basically go to these universities and they say hey Do you want to offer an online degree? We think it brings this much incremental revenue to your university and We will run the whole thing for you.

So you don't have to lift a finger and Here's what we want, you know, 30% of the of the tuition revenue and And right so what happened is all the universities said yes So there's a billion dollar company that's doing this that basically offers this to all the universities So there's if you go look all these you know traditional universities now have a online degree or certificate like certificate program That they offer and it's run by these other companies I forgot the name of what these companies are called. It was like some generic term but I think you could be that for corporations and so I think you could go to a corporation and say hey Would you like to basically have your own? You know develop a boot camp or? University for you know essentially we're gonna pop out people who are like management consultant types and It's good for your brand to get students early and anytime you hire one of them We take essentially a recruiter fee and we'll run the whole thing for you And so I think that's one way you could take advantage of this trend so VaynerMedia does this thing called three D's or I don't know what it's called something like that and It's 10 grand and you go to their office for a day and you learn how their business operates So if you're an agency owner you get that hang out with Gary Vaynerchuk for an hour But then they also have like the head of each department for an hour and they come in and they explain how their companies run And you have book in a box.

Oh You have book in a box here. Can you answer this actually? No special guest special guest just go out you can just go out here and answer it. He's just outside Well, we'll show who's coming in in a second, but anyway What was I saying you're about to say book in a box. Oh book in a box so Tucker who's on here He is thinking about do the same thing as well where users can pay a fee and they can come in and See how the company operates so book in a box itself is a little bit different booking a box is you want to write a book This is book in a box.

We're gonna help you write it promote it do the cover work all that stuff And they do this for like high profile business type of people who want to have their own book, right? And that business does good. It's a good business. Yeah, he bootstrapped it They have a he what's telling me he was like Amazon's gonna buy us for so much money That's what like the joke that he has said so who knows and what they want to do which is different It was just talking about what our idea is Give you exposure inside these companies to the like leadership of these companies at it.

Yeah, I take you on Corporate tours. Yeah, because book in a box what they're famous for is their culture is really good Like their own company culture. Yeah, interesting and so that's and we thought about doing it as well I mean, we're not big enough that we have something to offer but it's kind of a cool idea is where like I would do it for Other companies I would pay money to see it like if barstool did a thing where you could see how they're how they operate their business I would pay money and go Right and VaynerMedia what if you guys want to research this if you want to like if you think that your company is special and People would pay money to do it to see how big Vayner's is they put all their events on Eventbrite And you could see which how many tickets are selling per event and you can actually reverse engineer this and see how much revenue It's bringing in.

I like it. Okay. I have two ideas that are I've talked about this before I'm in a big company right now and it's my first time ever in a big 2000 person company and so I'm seeing all this stuff that I'm like either are Problems that need to be solved of a big company that I never saw before or homegrown solutions That I'm like dude that could be a standalone company this little homegrown thing we built and so I want to share What one of each With you on the podcast today So without further ado The first one I'll do is something that I wish I wish we had now.

This is a I'll call it This is kind of a farfetched idea, but personally I think this is valuable. So I'm sitting in a meeting and the way meetings work at any Amazon company I believe is You have this like heavy written culture So you write a doc you write a memo before you come in and it basically says, you know, here's here's what we're here to discuss Here's the context. Here's the potential solutions Here's what we believe is the recommended solution type of thing, right? You you write a memo that basically does a lot of the pre work of what you would normally discuss in the meeting and the first 20 minutes of the meeting are everybody reading this thing.

So it's silent There's like 15 people on a long boardroom Amazon you read the memo and nobody talks and then after 15 20 minutes Somebody basically says like hey is everyone done anybody need more time? And you're like now we're good to go and then probably somebody needs more time, but they don't say anything and then And then you start the discussion and the discussion the problem with meetings is You've guys like me who are like want to say stuff all the freaking time And so they just talk way more than anybody else Oh, hey, how's it going? We have a special guest we're recording right here.

So we have a special guest we're recording right here So if you're listening to this you don't have video Lance Armstrong just walked in As he does, you know at certain times And Lance Lance you want to pull up that chair for a minute? Just come sit for a year for a minute Here you can take this we're swing this around Actually, you know what take the take the red tier. I'm gonna sit on this We did not plan this so I know Neil Dempsey suckered me he's not sorry He just said you don't have to sit in here by the way either.

Oh, this is what I do. So Lance we were So we have this podcast here. Yeah every day Three days a week at this point. It feels like every day, right? Well our goal is to get to a hundred thousand daily listeners Yeah, per episode And we're doing a good job, yeah, we're getting close good. I bet you are you have a big big following I'm sure you are following and so the back story behind this podcast is and now we're doing videos and we're chopping it up like you do with Forward the forward the forward the forward and the move so that was the second one That's you know, yeah, the two or one's called the move and so what we've been doing is you may as well do video You get that'll get you that'll get you to a hundred thousand quicker It's helping a lot and so what we've been doing so Sean had a company that he just sold to twitch And I've got companies and all we've been doing is scheming out loud and for some reason people love listening to it Are they Maybe an hour they've been it's been working and we have like everyone's messaging us saying they're starting little things that we've been Riffin on good and we just I'd listen to a few I you know what I kind of get I do get I'll occasionally listen to Rogan if it's if it's a guest that I'm interested in the whole thing or the clip No, it's he goes along many three hours.

I'm like when I did it He was like I was like so how long now you think I'll be here. He's like that three hours like What I've never talked to anybody for three hours like no, I'm not talking for three hours. I'm not that interesting but Yeah, no, so I'll get into these crime ones me too me too like I got sucked into this Rude of evil. Yeah, it was just super fucked up. I've been listening to that one. You have the 12 hours after we have to Google and like follow up No, yeah, you're trying not to and then what was the other one that was I do serial killers, you know that one.

No, but they're all about serial killers, right? No, there's one called serial killers Yeah, and it's awesome. We crashed about we work kind of crime. I I listen to all those ones as well. Wow the Wondery and Park has yeah and they just one of them one of those companies just sold to Spotify a couple hundred million bucks. So did the ringer the ringer Bill Simmons just keeps making money Yeah, apparently I think he owned I bet you he owned the majority of that company So he probably walked away with a couple hundred million bucks for him We got to get you off the La Croix.

Have you seen the Austin? This is mine. I just leave them here Have you seen the new brand at Austin Waterloo? What's water? It's what it's like a sparkling water, but it's better. So this is the what the podcast I'm an investor full disclosure Okay, well, this is what the podcast is now, but they're crushing it. They're absolutely so what is it? It's a it's look What is it? It's sparkling water, but it's it's Yeah, I'm sure they do. I mean, it's all the rate well from the Austin office It's on their their HQs on it is on is on East Caesar Chavez as well So from from where the hustle is or at least where it's always not moved we move into a bike shop Okay, so you guys used to be on Caesar Chavez you moved up But so they're still on Caesar Chavez, which is where our studio is But no, they're just they're cool guys are killing it.

You know, how much did they raise? They just did a new round. It's 30 they raised I want to say I'm probably getting that wrong But they did 50 million sales last year. They're gonna go a hundred this year. Holy shit. No, they're they're knocking Yeah, it's it's it's it's lighter cleaner the can has they have all these different Yeah, they're the one story looking can like it's like past our it's like a white Well, they have a lot of flavors now. It's probably up to 10 or 12. It's like a retro looking can Yeah, it's real sort of green Yeah, it's real sort of groovy looking They brought in the guy that ran smart pop and sold that off and so he's the CEO so they got real Austin has a lot ventures is the big who Kavu ventures out of Austin.

That's the guy from the Vaca company. Is that the tea? So he Clayton was was from deep addy. He did sweet leaf tea deep addy And then went and started Kavu with two other guys. He's now since left, but Um, anyways, he's still on the board at Waterloo and Highbrew coffee, which is a big advertiser of ours No, I love what he was wrong with is boring what's wrong with you? What's wrong with this guy? He doesn't like making money You know, there's probably there's probably some charity right down the street where you could go give him all your dough from twitch And and give him all your time You know investing sounds fun and the initial pitch is fun.

Yeah, but once you give him a check because You're so handsome and I like it being a part of creating stuff Dude, it's like being an uncle you get all the fun stuff and not on me the hard work Yeah, I mean we we launched a fund and we almost Probably 90% of the companies were super involved with Well either through the board or being on the board or just They just need help. I mean, you know this I mean young entrepreneurs that they might have a great idea and Be smart people but they're gonna come across things.

They just need help navigating and and or Connecting them a minute with in our She and I asked him I said, you know, we have this other capital store right now like self funded by We can just keep self funding or we can take this I said you tell me like, you know, how much value that you guys really bring I'm ready to hear like the sales pitch and he goes honestly The worst companies need the most help and I can't save them the best companies never need my help and so And then there's everybody else in between.

Yeah, if I'm giving you this term sheet I hope you're the one of those that are the good companies that I really don't have any influence in I just get to take credit in the end and I was like I dig that honesty Wow true to me the best companies truly like Like I've only made a couple of investments, but Lambda School probably the best one done pretty well And you know that one like a needy girlfriend, you know, they're like one of the hot Silicon Valley companies doing super well And you know, I'll text the founder to be like, hey, what's up? You want to jam on ideas? You want me to help you with this problem? And he's like dude.

I'm just busy with all this fucking growth. I hate what we have right? I hate when investors ask what what I need anything This is what it feels like when you're winning when you're really really winning and you just are too busy for any of this bullshit Yeah, we won't tell Neil when he gets here. Well, I what I do is I said monthly updates and they're very clear and sustained And I'm very transparent and they're like how can I help? I'm like you can't unless you have ideas and you're gonna tell me how you can help do it But I don't I can't think of anything.

Yeah, like it's like I don't know how can you help you know what I mean It's like what are you gonna come in here and write emails for me and do work for me? I mean like I don't know they're like you need interest anyone. I'm like, who do you know? I don't know but that's I mean I think the intro part is big in our world and so you know in health and wellness fitness nutrition I mean, it's it's You know, I've been doing this for 30 years just as an athlete. So I've gotten to know Everybody I mean if if we make an invest these are just examples but we make an investment in a company like amp human and They need and it'd be very obvious that they'd be connected to Strava and vice versa.

It would take them a Month to get a call. I think you're different though. Yeah, that's your thank you Sam Well, that's your value is that's our value. Yeah, and everyone knows that you know everyone I mean you're a celebrity like you could get touch with everyone, but like if You know, I'm an investor. You're an investor. It's like they don't know who I know Yeah, and I probably don't know that many people who they can't just call the email. Yeah, do you know what I mean? Is that what your angle is gonna be is that you have there's that and we call I mean We refer to it as the flywheel just because you know now the one show the second show the move is about 15 million downloads a year And so, you know once that started to really take off then I I was getting all this interesting deal flow I thought to myself we should start a fund and invest in some of these companies and and then what happens when we reintegrate Or occasionally integrate some of our companies back into that audience right that core sticky group of 15 million people And so that's that's what here's Neil.

That's what we bring to it. Okay. Yeah, so Yeah, I mean there is the connections. There is the flywheel. There's the audience and then we got a pretty kickass advisory board that we pull into whether it's you know researching deal flow or or Sitting on boards So and we won't take up too much time. This was impromptu. So he said we're going to get a sandwich. We already ordered you food Oh, yeah, I already talked to Neil look at that. Well Neil texted me this morning and he's like hey Can I use your guys office? I go? Yeah, we got a conference room.

We'll take care of food So we already have everything for you dope Can I just say like all these parking garages around here? With the sign on that says open I went into like three of them the dudes like we're full I was like well, why don't you turn off the fucking sign? Like you've got ten cars in here that now all have to back up Because the sign says open which garage you park in well, I ended up parking right around the corner right here I hope that's the parking thing was yellow. It's a rental car.

Yep What a type of card you rent Well, hang on let's first figure out if I'm gonna get a ticket. So the thing was yellow. I put my card in bought an hour Well, I'll hook it up. We'll make it happen No, I know I got a great garage on the street that I park in okay Well, it's too late now. I gotta go to the airport soon, but I know what you really want to know what kind of car on it Yeah They gave me a it's like a suburban kind of thing Big as you drive a suburban anyway, right? I drive that at home.

So I didn't mind I like I know where everything is I'm back and I can You know, it's like my cockpit. So let me let me run one thing by then is Neil here So you were doing a thing so we talked about hotels out here or I've been riffing on hotels I'm really interested in hotels. Yep, because they're growing like the biggest hotels atop 10 They're growing at a really high clip right now because young people are doing experiences more You George Hinkappy has this thing called a domestic Yep, and you were doing a ride there where someone could pay a fee and hang out with you for two days Well, we call it a camp.

Yeah, it's probably four days of riding right and something that's been interesting us me and I've been bringing up is Hotels that offer more experiences Yeah, and so it could be as small as being filled with Peloton bikes Yeah, which I have found myself going to more hotels just because I have a high quality gym Are you did you see that his hotel or the domestic did it get increased bookings because of that? Because of that camp that we sold. Yeah, and well, here's the yeah, I mean, it's an inch his hotels It's only I think 12 or 13 rooms.

So it's pretty easy to fill up So if we announce and we're here and I are doing the same thing in my work in September, but it's a separate hotel But obviously But when we announce that camp it just kind of fills up, you know, it would It'd be a different jam if it was a 200 room hotel And that's his problem right he can either sell he either has one room full Or two rooms or he could sell 200 rooms right 13 is a tough number I would love for that to happen and that's what I told you.

I think my phone's ringing by the way I think it might be Neil you can answer that he wants to come up That's what I told you. I wrote an email to you one time I was like you need you need to become the Jimmy Buffett of weekend warriors Right, and you need to have a hotel where people could come and dude Jimmy Buffett. I mean he's a Neil I guess I couldn't answer your call. I got roped into a podcast Neil You're you're being filmed right now. Just say hi right there the camera. I'll wrap up here in a second Yeah, but I mean Jimmy's he's branded everything whether it's blenders.

He's doing nursing homes now Jimmy Buffett is yes So, I mean he's got I mean the when when I talk about Jimmy Buffett I mean if you think about a Jimmy Buffett fan like a parrot head, right? So if it's the day of the show in Dallas, Texas, which I say that because that's my mom and stepdad go every time From the minute they wake up he's owning them right they're listening to serious exam They're listening to his station right probably at some point pregame. They're drinking his beer the Landshark beer Then they then he's they buy the ticket which is again his They get to the show they're buying his swag they go back or they pregame they like pregame or tailgate out there They're using this margarita blender.

He's got everything and he has a then he has a hotel He's got the his clothes clothes, right? I mean Armstrong not the Jimmy Buffett of weekend Warriors Well hotel Jimmy Jimmy, I don't know if you paid attention the last seven right, you know, we're getting back there But oh it could happen. I'm telling you yeah Like what the world that I want to live it is like I can like these UFC cannabis. He's all in a canvass Yeah, the coral reefer. That's what it's called. That's what it's called the coral reefer These UFC guys are kind of doing it where you could pay money and go and work out with them and live at their gym Yeah, man layered hamlet layered Hamilton's doing it You know I did for a sec and I did now dancers now.

I just I don't know that's how you can I just I just didn't I don't know didn't feel right Yeah I wouldn't do cameo that's how you could tell which celebrities broke by how much they're how much they're so there's brother is not stopped. You're like oh this is a set it. Oh Like Gilmore Gilbert Godfrey is charging $50 for a two minute slot. This guy's broke by the way that Nice Nice people I talked to them, you know when I they're great. No, but you Do it well, but yeah, but like It's like Uncle Joey from Full House is really hurting He's only charging 50 bucks for a three minute spot like these these broke I feel this is horrible.

Where's Snoop is charging two grand. He's the one who's doing good Snoop charges two grand on cameo No, something like that. Yeah, I got TJ Lavin from Or whatever he's the max I got TJ Lavin to say hi to my wife for like a hundred dollars I don't even know that is he's like on the real world It's stupid But that's how you could tell who's broke is by what they charge on cameo The more they charge the more broke they are less if they charge a little bit of money Then they're really here and I said mine high and it was just you know, it was to be boring.

Why would anybody pay that? Anyways, I would pay can I I thought Neil and I were gonna go have lunch. Oh, yeah Well, you eating lunch with us or you're gonna keep podcasting. I'm gonna wrap up here in a few minutes Yeah, let's go. We'll go here. So why don't you guys I don't want to take the seat the whole time We were just kids lads. I didn't expect to do this. So we were just killing time Yeah No, that's mine Oh wait, let me get up in this And then Jack is gonna be here in a few minutes, too Thank you.

We'll talk to you. Yeah, that conference room over there is all yours That was a good surprise. Yeah, that was fun I Don't know what's gonna happen with this podcast gonna be interesting. It's gonna either be great or not great I'm not gonna be in the between so Okay, so are you gonna wrap up because if you want to wrap up we can we can either do two minutes of more stuff We can do two minutes. I don't know what can you pull up the the sheet again? Is it's got like email on this was a crazy For those listening Sean and I had this thing planned out and we were gonna do a normal episode.

No, this is great This is life happens you take life We had Lance Armstrong just show up and come in come into the if Lance Armstrong walks into your podcast you Do exactly what just happened you get the fuck up you let Lance Armstrong sit down and you talk to Lance Armstrong for 10 minutes You don't worry about anything else. So if it matters. I mean, this is what our office is like We do get a lot of cool people coming by. Yeah The guy that Lance was with the gentleman you maybe just saw on camera his name is Neil Dempsey He won't ever tell me this.

I'm pretty sure Neil's a billionaire and Neil's one of my investors and Neil will have a felt like a billionaire. I felt that Billy energy We'll have him we'll have him on the podcast sometime But basically he was in his he was trying companies and kept failing and up into his late 30s early 40s he was failing failing failing he's got a job at a VC and Met this guy starting a coffee shop brought to the VC everyone laughed at him and said no We're not investing this stupid. So Neil invested his own personal money into it and that company ended up being star Starbucks And so Howard Schultz CEO of Starbucks says that Neil's one of the people he looks up to and he's one of my investors They named the stadium one of the stadiums at Washington in Washington.

Is it Washington University or University of Washington? They named it. It's called Dempsey Stadium because he donated. So he's a big deal. That's cool. This is that's legit our office That's a great story Wow, how to follow that. Okay I I think that We should probably kind of wrap it up and hope that there is some value in here for people Yeah, okay. Okay. I love me. Let me toss out one idea because we owe people ideas and let me toss out one good idea Which one okay, I'm gonna do the I'm gonna do the one I started so I started off talking about okay these meetings are our meetings are meetings basically are like the the bread and butter of big companies and so I calculated we have on on every floor We have like 20 meeting rooms say and nine floors.

So it's called 10 floors. There's 200 meeting rooms and Every hour, let's assume. I don't know 80% of it is occupied So I basically did the math and saw how many hours and then you think oh every meeting is on average five people in it And so you start to realize how many people hours are spent in meetings and then when you look at a meeting While it's happening. There's basically no technology. So the only technology in a meeting is like video conferencing typically And I think that's kind of crazy and so I actually believe That there's someone out there who could build a meeting a meeting kit of some kind that makes meetings more More effective more efficient and I'm not talking about like transcribing although that's one possibility what I'm thinking about more is like the ability to give So I'm imagining like a physical device and You push it when you want to say something so this doesn't reward Interrupters and loud voices because you sort of buzz in when you're ready to talk So just has a little light next to your thing that says Sean sounds like you have something ended at the memo thing that alone is worth it Well, the memo doesn't require any like there's no business there, right? Like companies just adopt that principle of the process wrong and here's why I think you're wrong is Axios is coming out with this and there was another a new product called recess that just launched and all it is is a software It's ass.

So it's a service you pay money and you get this internal emailing tool that helps you write Internal emails better to your company and it tells you who read it and who didn't so it's more concise or what does it help? Yeah, because Axios is super concise as is. Yeah, I think basically I think that there's a meeting tech That will sound really boring But if you just think about how much of business happens in meetings how many hours how much salary is spent every hour in these meetings If you could make a 10% lift and how good the communication was or how well that meeting ran That's a big big lift and I don't think anybody's really Doing much interesting stuff there.

I think people only really worry about like how do you schedule the meeting and how do you conference into the meeting? There's a lot of money built running the meeting meetings And yeah, I don't and those are successful, but I think the meeting itself could use some improvement anyway, so trying to throw in an idea here, but this will be known as The Lance Armstrong podcast. Yeah, we'll actually get them in here a real time this I hope that people will get value for this I think we should publish this but we'll apologize that it's only I maybe yeah, and we have a ton of ideas to go through for tomorrow You you have a few on here that I'm like you're curious about yeah, so we'll get to tomorrow All right tomorrow Peace out.
