Duration: 54 minutes, 57 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

All right, we're here Sam. Nope. That's not Sam. That's do wow No, Steve friend of the hustle Great to be in hustle tell the people who is stew stew is a friend of the hustle I actually met Sam through a mutual mentor Chris Redlett shadow Chris Redlett's last mile And transmedia capital and you work out of here. I do work out of here. It's incredible man I was working at a home and so was my partner and for the people that know me on the phone about 12 hours a day Most of my things are just brokering deals and she kicked me out Right, so here I am Sam took in one of the refugees like you guys talked about last time.

That's me Yeah, and we after the last episode you were you were listening in and Normally after every episode we're like, you know, how was it to the people that were kind of in the room? And it's usually like good. Yeah liked it and you were like it was good But here's three things I think you guys could do better and I was like nice. Who's this guy? No one likes it? Yes, man. Yeah, no one likes the yes man Especially if you're trying to make something great you always want to nobody also likes a hater so you need an honest person You know hundred percent and so you were honest.

I like that and then we started talking about I don't know how we start Talking about ideas. We just bumped into each other started immediately jamming on some ideas and I was like hold on This should have been recorded come by next week. Let's do this and also I am with Sam gone And we got to say he's with the Gary V podcast and you're stuck with me, so I don't know who's winning that one I'm winning dude. I'm not trying to be on one of those Instagram posts where it starts out with his signature on the screen his autograph to start I will say This office now compared to last week.

We got to say Henry put in a ton of work This office looks a thousand times better than Gary V's podcast Henry. What do you have a Twitter handle? Henry Billings five Incredible for everyone that's just listening at home what the studio used to look like is if close your eyes and imagine Yeah, two wealthy guys went on Amazon and they searched by highest price for comfortable chair and they bought it and they found Right red chair and they found a broom closet and put it in there with some of their books And now it looks like a legitimate studio now studio.

Yeah, there's like the soundproofing shit on the walls There's posters behind us. We like a very like prestigious looking book that just says Sam It's like it's like he died and we have a tribute here shout out to Sam come back safe So Sam did the Gary V podcast and he did a pomps podcast if you don't know pomp here You're not in the crypto world this guy who's always talking about Bitcoin So Sam's on tour right now doing a couple other things. They did a meetup of listeners and trend subscribers in New York. I saw it was awesome.

They're popping off Did you see the feedback from that? I saw the feedback more importantly. I saw the videos like oh some nice Airbnb like yeah You guys went all out for this. I hope it's the business around here. Yeah We're spending now. We're spending I thought so that was cool. It was really incredible I think what I love about the hustle and what you guys are building here is the engaged passionate community Yes, it's the only way to build something successful is to be surrounded by people like yourselves and everyone that was there was saying Hey, it's not like you just go somewhere shake hands share a business card It's like businesses are coming off the back end of that right people are actually starting shit And you know, I would say to I'll give you two principles that these stories tell me about number one the most the most important startup commandment is is You'd rather have a thousand people who love you than a million people who just kind of like you you know who could forget about you if two weeks went by and What I love about this podcast even though we have these really aggressive growth goals I know we already did the hard part that we have thousands of people who just love this podcast And this is my favorite podcast Give me more and that's pretty good, but take that to your own business.

It's easy to be like oh, it's only a hundred It's only a thousand. It's only ten thousand customers right now But the real question is do they love you because if they love you you have a very high chance of getting the next ten thousand Next hundred thousand people to feel the same way every great brand that we've seen especially in the DTC space Customer centricity. It's at the heart of what they're doing. I don't know if you saw yesterday Moise was saying about at the start 24 seven he was on the phones in the emails responding to anything personally.

Yeah, he's an animal It's a nine hundred million dollar business and he brought this up when I did the interview with him. He goes I I forgot who you mentioned like whatever the big old spice like the big deodorant brands I was growing up against he goes They don't know who their customers their customers target target buys their shit and puts it on the shelf If they wanted to get in touch with the people who love their product They wouldn't even have their email address They don't have their connection and he so he realized early on with you know He was doing DTC before DTC was the buzzword It was just called ecommerce back then and it wasn't super sexy to be doing But he was doing you know D.

Deodorant sales and he realized hey I have this relationship directly with the customer. I could talk to them they could talk to me I could send them more products and say hey try this out. Is this better? I can write them a thank you note that sort of thing and I that was The underrated at the time the big difference is if you go to Moise and you ask him who your customer is He's gonna give you a specific example and if you go to other competitors They're gonna show you a slide demographic says oh, this is Sarah the shopper right? Yeah, Sarah the shopper is between the ages of 15 and 50 right and then all the marketing guys We're gonna be a sort of nod and clack exactly.

Yeah customer centricity But yeah again happy to be here. Love what you guys are doing Yeah, we're gonna get into a couple ideas the second principle that I think is really important So I just bumped into stew just doing the podcast and I would say two two things come from this There's this phrase proximity is power shout out Tony Robbins If you don't know any better and you want to build your network you want to be around more successful people You want to be more successful yourself? One of the best things you can do is just get near them like I was just in the office You were in the office and boom connection made that's what happened with Mike Brown the kind of guy who was on the podcast earlier Who's does oil and gas in Texas? We're just here.

We bump into each other. I moved to San Francisco on a lark just for that I was like I just better go where's your mix? I was in Australia was as far as you could be from San Francisco No, I was just there on a different adventure for the Commonwealth. Yeah, I'm from Canada So a similar story if you don't mind me saying go for it Before what I'm doing now I helped found this company called factory and then let it at the end and it was literally We were a handful of guys between Stockholm New York and Calgary and all we wanted to do was not just read in books about how success is made but meet them We wanted to get where are people solving the biggest challenges in the world and actually come here So we moved use the field of dreams approach We said if we build it they will come win on Craigslist found the biggest house We could find put our money together got it shouts out 711 Scott Street, right and And it was the factory that co living co working space.

It was anything and everything. Oh, I've heard so much about this That's us. Oh, okay, but all it was was a network of thought leaders entrepreneurs executives where we put on everything from Workshops talks dinners all we cared about was having the best people in the world Our house. Yeah to tell us what is making you different? What is making you tick? How are you building products right because if you're reading books, which is fantastic? I do a lot of it. I know you do you're gonna say hey product is everything No marketing is everything customer centricity is everything But really you have to go there find out for every industry for every vertical for every product What makes it different right and who are the entrepreneurs that actually making it happen? Yeah, and just get around them like you don't have to you don't have to figure out step two just get around it It's the fastest path to you know sort of improving your odds of success is get really close Literally proximity get nearby other successful people work out of their office hang out with them go to a car working space Whatever it is, but get around successful people even there's a lot of people on this podcast I imagine that are probably living in like the rural states rural Canada.

Yep, you know people like we were Cold emailing works. Yep, like anyone that cold emails me I respond I know you guys are the exact same way even all these executives. It's been really big on Twitter How fast the response time was it's like if you have a clear concise message and you either a want mentorship You want to ask a question or you want to give them a piece of feedback? They will respond right and how not to do it is just hey, can I get some time some of your time? Hey, I'm Sean.

Uh huh love you Get can I have a minute 30 minutes or an hour of your time or can I get a coffee? That's the worst way to do it 100% best way to do it is hey, I'm Sean. I'm whatever 22 years old I'm from this place. I'm doing this interesting thing or I really want to do this interesting thing You I really appreciate the things you're doing. I've shared out your blog post. I've told my friends about your podcast Would you take a look at my slide deck? Would you play around my product and give me two bullet points of what you think I could be doing better? Hey, I'm gonna be in your city and you know the next event you guys do I will organize it for you Tell them you're doing something interesting be humble about it and and then make it clear and simple Lightweight ask don't ask for time.

Don't ask for coffee. How many generic in males? Are you getting a week? 100 on a daily basis This is kind of how I measure the success of the podcast on a daily basis I get 30 to 40 inbound new messages from people and That's across email LinkedIn and Twitter DMs LinkedIn I get to like three months later, but Twitter DMs and email I check every morning I said about 30 or 40 unique people doing that not a huge number, but for me That's like the best part of my day is that wake up. All right, who reached out who said that, you know, they like something from this They're doing something interesting.

They want to work together. I've invested now in two companies from the wow listeners I've like in conversations with several others and so this has been a big deal for me. Wow, what set them apart? So the first guy I think some people might have heard him on the live show. He was a super credible entrepreneur So he was like, yeah, I you know, I currently you know right now I run this division of the self driving department at uber Yeah, and I'm leaving to start my own self driving car company and here's what I'm doing differently than everybody else Wow, so I was like, okay to get to that position at uber.

You got to be pretty legit You have a unique insight that you can you can tell me very clearly And then the third thing was like as I probed the story just got better as I got to know him I was like what more impressed. Yes, as I saw what he had done more impressed and I was like, okay Here's you invested. Yeah. Okay. How long did it go from email to close? So we met we emailed we met for lunch, which is an hour by the end of the lunch I was like should I just go work for this guy like I was and which is my like ultimate sign of I should invest and then I went and checked out their prototype like I've gotten the car and That was an hour and then the last thing I did was I brought my former co founder CTO from Bebo Who's who's with me right now at twitch and I said hey, I need you to assess this from a technical point of view and So he went met the guys, you know said a bunch of words that I didn't understand and walked away being like yeah I'm also gonna invest and I was like great.

So that was my due diligence So I would say four individual hours over the course of about two weeks. Wow. That's like did you see first round? I think was first round came out and said that if they look back ten years ago It took them nine weeks to close and if they look now it's taking them nine days Yeah, as a if you're an angel you really need to make decisions within two meetings Yes, my you know the first meeting you need to be able to rule them out If it's an if it's a no and if it's a yes You need to be really clear what that second meeting needs to be yeah And then you can do your own research outside of that to check the market talk to a couple competitors talk to some customers Whatever you need to do to get comfortable But like speed is when you don't have pedigree and you don't have more capital than anyone else speed is your best asset I agree because everyone's gonna say that they can help and a smart entrepreneur knows like a you're not gonna help that much Yep, and be Everybody says they help so how can I tell who's actually super helpful until you have a great track record? Then you're like, okay, this person was a part of these great successes already I agree with you fully just to go on that.

Do you mind if I plug something really quick do it? I'm gonna actually I'm gonna plug the hustle okay, so going into talking about investing how you move forward What's that first step? Did you read the trend support this week? Yeah, I saw they were like I'm gonna invest they're gonna invest some money into startups that it came out of the community a hundred percent if we think about and You talked to Sam a lot about it over the last four years When he got the deal flow he heard of those first ideas that were coming out that are now billion dollar businesses that he completely Missed or that he could have helped earlier on and help them get to where they are now much earlier right? It's incredible.

Do you know of any of those examples? You might not because it's Sam's I know a couple of them I don't know if I should share okay, but there's some big ones out there And so I know these guys have been talking about it for a while It's like how do we help the community like how do we be that catalyst? So now it's not just for trend subscribers either. It's like obviously shouts out to trends We want you to get on there and get those nice and ideas right but for anyone listening I want you to email Henry actually Henry B at the hustle.co

Your best business idea and if it is chosen will give you a thousand dollars Henry B A thousand dollars. We'll also find any resources that you possibly need to help this thing scale. That's pretty good. All right I like it. It's like did you read atomic habits? I've read about a third of it so far So what really stuck out what these guys are doing great here? And then what I want kind of every entrepreneur to hit on is understanding the difference between motion and action Every entrepreneur thinks they're in action, but legitimately they're talking about the idea talking about you with the idea Tweeting about the idea, but how are you taking that forward? Mm.

And so the big thing here It's like I want to help you and trends and you want to help them go from motion to getting into action And if it's a thousand dollars that it's gonna be that catalyst. That's what makes sense So what's the difference motion action? Okay motion talking about it thinking about it You're not actually doing anything but action is what action is putting up that first page calling customers Actually go try to sell the thing rapid prototyping it like putting it into action like not blaming anyone else But legitimately putting it into action to try to turn this into a real business So use this as your excuse obviously the thousand bucks not gonna make or break your situation But just treat it as the catalyst to take the thing you that's been in the back of your mind and bring it to the forefront Take some action on it.

I want to see all the ideas and as a trends community We'll all vote on them. I like it and we're gonna we're gonna also Follow track and show the community the progression of the companies that are in it cool Okay, we got some topics that we wanted to talk about so what do you want to start so? Did you watch the Tyson fury fight? I did I'm a I'm not a huge boxing fan But I'm a fan of greatness and I like combat sports in general. There we go I I was lucky enough. I actually watched it with Sam and Sam as you know a big boxing fan and I Think I know a lot of Patriots fans will say the 28 threes the greatest comeback story in sports I think Tyson fury is the greatest comeback so explain the Tyson fury story So just so we can I'm gonna start at the end.

Okay, Tyson fury knocked out Deonti Wilder in the seventh round Deonti Wilder is known as the baddest man on the planet, right? Never never been defeated and he's he has a 96% knockout rate Right 42 fights 41 knockouts exactly like that only person he hasn't knocked out was his last Tyson fury fight So Tyson fury started off. He's this English boxer also known as the gypsy king He was eight weeks premature Weighing it at one pound right okay almost didn't make it just from the beginning right one pound one pound Which is crazy because if you see him now he's six nine six six hundred seventy five pounds exactly exactly And that's in that slim for him which we'll get into But his dad knew greatness his dad was one of those people that understood that this guy's gonna be a champion And so we named him Tyson after the great Mike Tyson Obviously years go by years go by he starts training his dad was a boxer his uncle's a boxer's everyone in his family as boxers and He gets to this point where he's like the next contender coming up.

He's 23 years old he gets invited into Vladimir Klitschko's actual fighting camp itself and Kind of going back to your guys's point last week about hearing doubters Everyone always told Tyson fury you're gonna go to this camp, but Vladimir Klitschko is the king Right even you're there. He's gonna batter you as a sparring partner. And so he was training with me. He's like this guy's not that great I'm gonna get into his head these guys. They weren't even boxing against each other at this time Not opponents. So during the training camp itself. They go into the sauna.

Okay. Have you heard the sauna story? I'm not sure the story. No, you haven't heard. I'm excited. This is maybe my my favorite story in sports. So Everyone knows and everyone tells Tyson fury Vladimir Klitschko is not just the king of the ring Vladimir Klitschko is the king of the sauna. Okay, look everyone here. Henry post a photo of what Vladimir Klitschko looks like this time He's a monster. Yeah, he's enormous. He's a Russian monster. He's a Russian monster. You created your Russian monster So this guy's huge So they go into and Tyson fury's everyone's telling him you got to get out of the sauna as fast No one can last as long as them and he says I'm not even fighting this guy.

I'm gonna get into his head I want to beat him now because I know I'm gonna be champion later and people say I can't do something I'm gonna do it. Okay, so they get in there. It's hot. It's really warming up Five minutes go by ten minutes go by there's about a dozen people in there people are dropping off right someone's leaving Other person's leaving about 20 minutes come in and it's only Tyson fury Vladimir Klitschko left. So Vladimir Klitschko, you know stands up Tyson fury is like thank goodness. He's about to pass out Vladimir Klitschko turns up the heat Sit back down and so Tyson fury says I can't let this guy get in my head.

Everyone thinks I can't beat him I'm gonna get up to he gets up. You know what he does turns up grabs a newspaper He lays down and he grabs a newspaper right another 25 minutes go by they're in legitimately as hot as the sauna can go and Klitschko finally leaves Tyson fury wins seems like I can't just leave right now He'll know that I was just trying to beat him waits a little bit longer basically passes out Years go by three four years go by Tyson fury is the number one contender This goes to champion which goes to champion.

He hasn't lost in something like 11 years 11 years hasn't lost right everyone's like Tyson fury. You cannot beat Klitschko Tyson fury goes, you know what? I know all of you think I can't do this I'm gonna do it on his home court. I don't come to the UK. I don't want to fight you at Wembley I want to fight you in like Eastern Europe. So they fight in Germany and then so in the pre fight They do a face to face similar to how we are now Tyson fury brings up the sauna issue and Klitschko everyone look up the clip is so like Pretends like it didn't happen like he couldn't remember it and Tyson fury says after the fight He knew that's when he beat him and he goes in and he batters right he batters Klitschko wins right becomes the lineal champion Three three class champion, whichever by the way, I love this lineal champion lineal champion If for those who don't fall boxing is just You're you beat the man who beat the man who beat the man who beat the man all the way back in time to the first man Exactly, and so you have taken the champion you took the champion out.

Yes, and nobody's taking you out yet You were the linear champion. He's the linear champ. So this is 2015 So the thing was is that after this fight Tyson fury didn't go on and actually Fight Klitschko again, right? He balloons up to 400 pounds. He's at the mountaintop He's like is this it is this it and he's earning from everyone. He couldn't do it again He can't do it again and it's finally somewhat getting to him. He becomes addicted to drugs He gets addicted to booze. He's 400 pounds and everyone says I knew it I knew Tyson fury was a bum, right? Right, and so finally something in his mind clicks 2017 this video comes out him jogging his face is Monsters size of a bastard.

He's ready. He looks like someone who ate Tyson fury exactly and he there's this video Everyone's got to see it and he says he says it's like John Ty Wilder I'm coming for you and everyone says he's never gonna tell me talking about he's failed so many times He'll never come back. Yeah, and let a look obviously he fights him. He comes back. He drops 150 pounds It was a draw the first fight Time comes back. They're like, you know what Tyson fury season not going back. He's gonna do the WWE thing He got his payday.

He's gonna go drink again comes back Obviously this past Saturday knocks out actually knocks out the knockout artist a hundred percent no one thought he could do it Right, and so I just thought it was this really interesting story For a lot of the points that even we were talking about last week or you guys were talking about last week when it came down to people saying No, right people not wanting to see success happen Everyone wants to see you lose and he took that as energy came back like four separate times Right from the brink like four separate times and made it happen.

I just thought it was just so I can tell you're kind of like me in that Maybe the thing I respect most is someone's mentality. Yes their mental toughness and And I don't I don't even think I particularly great at this But it's something that I've decided is sort of the number one most important asset is how how is your mindset? A hundred percent how is your mindset with things are good? Are you grateful? Are you appreciative? Are you a giver to others? Yes, how is your mindset when things are bad? Yes? Are you resilient? Do you do you turn the disadvantages to advantages and mindset is number one? That's why you love fury.

Yes, doesn't matter that he knocked out. It matters how his mind worked I mean he was at a point where most people break Angela Duckworth would call it grit right what this guy has right? I when I read that book all I could think about was Tyson fury Yeah, but it all comes down to mindset all the great leaders have it Admiral William McRaven is another great example obviously one of the greatest admirals in Navy SEALs history and special ops history same thing He's a great leader because of how his mindset is right This is why sports is great.

It's the metaphor. It's the grand metaphor for life Who cares about these guys punching each other in the head or throwing a ball in a hoop? But it is the great and real post a bunch of the things that we talked about I want everyone to go to the hustle and my first million everyone on Twitter And I want you to all look at these links and be inspired. Yes. Love it And it was a great fight. It was very much and he gave us a nice little ballad at my Easy he sings a song when he wins which is hilarious and part of like his market abilities that he's just like crazy character He's crazy.

He was dancing before the fight. Yeah, don't say while they're was stretching and he was literally dancing By the way super lame excuse by dante wilder that his costume was too heavy and that's why he lost No, you lost cuz very punchy in the head. Yeah. All right. So what else we got? So let's do a couple of the idea So let's go down. We're gonna skip this one Let's do a couple of the ideas that that we were chatting about last time So if you were here for the sports, you got what you wanted if you were here for the ideas.

This is the time Okay, so what are some of the ideas that are interesting to you? Well last week when I was sitting in you guys mentioned that religion overall is declining and I didn't think that was right and so I looked at the numbers and actually there's 66 million people coming and I'm just gonna speak towards Christianity sure 66 million new Christians every single year, right people being born into it people Converting and so on with only 26 million people leaving the church, which means 40 million net net positive 3.3 billion by 2050, right? Which is pretty incredible and I don't know on Instagram if anyone that's listening to the podcast follows But there's a lot of actual Christian entrepreneurs and Christian influencers.

So you have people like Carl Lance, Rich Wilkerson Jr Voo church even let me ask are you a religious guy or are you interested in this from a just a curiosity and business point of view? Both both, okay So I like I'm part of a men's group like a men's Christian group and it's interesting and like kind of diving into the idea itself A lot of my friends have kids that are growing up Every single way that the church traditionally engages with this younger This younger demographic is outdated, right read the Bible read the Bible You know listen to me talk, but sit down and listen exactly there.

It there's no way right now There's no media company coming out There's there's really nothing out there for new age consumers Gen Z's millennials to actually engage with the church Right, so we're thinking this is not like this is an area where there's 40 million people every single year joining That's a pretty fantastic growth, right? Billions of built in customers and by 2050 obviously they're getting born right now for the most part or the people like us It's like how are they going to engage with the church itself? There's there's only a handful of companies that are somewhat looking into this But if we look at even the way that culture is trending look at Kanye West last album Yeah, legitimately a gospel album look at some of the brands that are really taking off right now fear of God Jerry Lorenzo, right? a Christian backed Fashion company, right, but there's only a handful of them The opportunity is massive to create either a media company or you know, you could be selling books You could whatever it might be to engage with those younger consumers So I got a couple ideas.

So someone in someone from the community like you said somebody who's taken action He messaged me. He said give me three months. Mm. So give me three months. What? Three months and he sent me a link and he And not you know, I hope he's okay with me sharing this. I'll ask him afterwards We could bleep this whole thing otherwise, but he said give me three months and I'm gonna show you That I can get this business off the ground. I'm gonna get on your show. Wow, and he goes. What is what's the business? He goes tithing.

Wow. So he goes digital tithing. So basically Let's give it an algae Venmo for churches So he goes love this company called push pay that is currently processing four billion dollars a year of Digital donations inside a church. So instead of passing the hat around they pass. I don't know the QR code around or whatever it is It's like you can donate to the church through through it out and Tithely is another one. So push pay four point two billion. That's their processed amount They took 98 million Wow, so this is a very simple fintech company to build Distribution you can tell how you would distribute it to customers through the churches themselves who have a high incentive Because you know if you're a church you need to ask for money and then you grow or you don't ask for money And then you shrink and potentially close even if we think what this from a church's perspective as well It'll help them with all their accounting, right every week every Sunday Saturday whenever you're going to church They're accepting cash, right? Someone has to sit down and like sit down You know is this tithing money is this for something else? So just the accounting of it imagine how much more simple that'll be They said 15% I was looking into a little bit 15% of all donations now in the churches is digital But I bet that that's so I bet that that's already, you know, you know five fold increase from where it was a few years ago and I bet it's gonna go further I think it gets to 30 40 percent over time and And so this is just churches and you know just one faith So there's a you can copy an existing model take it to another faith.

You could just compete against these So let's say tithing is one let's say, you know surface area where you might go for what's another well Just going on that that one point right there. What is really interesting is did you see bird come out with payments this week? Yes, do you think bird is gonna get it? They're gonna have bird payments at the front of all Exactly. No, I don't think I think bird is in the sort of last minute. Hail Mary type thing. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay. Well interesting What is another one the biggest one to me just comes down to engagement, right? You already have a Passionate community of young people that want to be engaged with the church what we've seen a lot of is merchandise Right, so how can you physically show that you were engaged with the Christian or Catholic or whatever your church actually is right? So influencer marketing obviously being big Preacher sneakers is a really interesting Instagram happening.

It's big preacher sneakers Well, preachers sneakers shows what all the preachers globally are actually wearing right now So it's like how can you create a brand directly for them themselves? And that's the perfect bridge of like the faith and how Gen Z. Yeah, you know crossover there So that really gets me excited. Yeah, so I like the media business idea I think that's a pretty straightforward one although probably not the most lucrative We had talked a little bit about Beautiful Bibles or beautiful Bibles to talk about this. I like this idea a lot. Well, I'm just you think to yourself It's you if you have if you were a Christian or whatever your religion might be Let's just say for Christianity sake you go to someone's house I guarantee you their Bible is hidden away because it got passed down to them.

They got it for free and it's all It's it's hideous, but if you think of what is on I shouldn't say hideous, but it's not the best looking book I'm a Russian. It's okay But if I think what is on people's coffee tables right now, it's kinfolk, right? It's things that they're going that they're buying that are beautifully bound that their visual and so I think there's this really great opportunity to Reinvent what the Bible actually looks like and create like the kinfolk of Bibles. Yes, so Number one most selling book of all time. Yes, the Bible.

That's a good place to start The IP again, you can print your own Bible So it's not like you're gonna go reprint fifty shades of gray and get sued Yeah, you can go reprint this and it could work You can remix it so you can simplify you can distill you can pull out certain anecdotes. I Love this idea. So the only reason I'm not doing this idea is because I'm not religious But even me I'm just like maybe I would do this and know it's like I love how you just said pull out specific books Yeah, so Netflix didn't really a pretty interesting movie on the book of Mark Right and so like how can you take some of the stories that were within there and actually have them come to double click into those? Yeah, yeah, I like that a lot So so I think this Generally speaking taking the sort of number one most bestselling book of all time or if you look at the Geeta or the Quran or whatever These are all in the top sellers of all time And if you can you know put a remix on it So aesthetically pleasing is where I would go with it first the other side of it is you know distilling it down for kids making it more Kid friendly or like you said going into sort of some of the lesser told or pulling out some of the anecdotes and stories I'm really bringing them to life in a different way million new customers a year, right do it as a YouTube channel Do it as a book.

I think these are I think this is really interesting if someone's doing this reach out to me I want to help you make this successful. I put a lot of thought into into how you would go about doing this And I genuinely think this is really really really fascinating idea and this influencer preacher thing. What's up with that? It is so it's funny. I thought a lot about it and guys in my men's group And I think it's a really great way to bring kind of the youth back into like Christianity for instance But they have millions of followers, you know, they're with beaver all the time Carl Lentz is the first one I saw that was doing this.

I'll answer the biggest you got to think he was leading Hillsong, right? And if you dressed a little differently, you could pass us like a car lens that might be that might be my next move We'll see if they reach I saw him and I was like this guy's good looking This is a hair and fellow stylish funny fantastic speaker speaks in like common, you know common tongue not like you know He'll use slang. Yeah, and I was like no wonder this guy's friends with all the basketball players and you know musicians that everybody knows about He've reformed beaver 100% no, it's really interesting and he's speaking to them on their level That is really the biggest thing and so people understand that this is like Being I want to be a strong Christian, let's say and I want it to be aspirational yet attainable I can be him right instead of like the typical preacher.

You'll see it a lot of the churches It's like you could look up to someone like Carl Lentz being like that is someone I want to aspire to be right and there's also Sort of a musical component. So he's with the Hillsong Church I think if they put out like tons of great, you know faith based music I think that faith based music is a pretty big space. So here's a question I had about this, right? Because I've Brainstorm these I broke some of them down. I've done a bit of research and so then I asked myself I believe in these ideas.

Okay, but I'm not doing I'm not doing these ideas. Yep. The big part of it for me It's just time. I got a lot. I do the podcast. I have a job. I have you know other stuff going on so For someone like you entrepreneurial Christian, why don't you do this idea? I I'm one of these. Oh, I'm in the same place as you. I'm also time limited. It's all time limited I will do anything to help these get off the ground any of the ideas we'll talk about right It's like you want to see people take these really nice and interesting ideas that are big and help them come to life And so if I had more time on my hands, I would love to help it and where do you stand on? Where do you stand on ideas where you don't have that same founder fit? So let's take another let's say I did have the time.

Okay, right? I magically get 48 hours on my day so I can play with my baby. I can do my job I can invest in companies I can do the podcast. Oh my god I do the side hustles I can do it all so let's say I had double the time and now I could now I'm not time restricted You know the second question for me I think I'm really into the should I do this and is this the right business for me? Because there's one thing to understand at an intellectual level There's another thing to really like love the product care about it and get into all those details So I think a lot of people come into this question of like yes, should I go for something? I'm quote unquote passionate about or know about or I am the customer or should I do something that's sort of I see the opportunity And it might be a great market opportunity You know it's like our buddy Ramon who you know created the most popular soap opera soap opera blog in the world and never Watch a soap opera in his life and sold it for nine million cash.

So I've seen both examples Where do you stand on this my whole thing? I think I think entrepreneurs have to be at different stages in their life So for where Ramon was at he's not saying soap opera blog. This is the hundred year brand This is something that when people say what did Ramon do to leave this earth? He changed the lives of people watching soap operas. He said how can I especially where he was at in his life? How can I make money right and he says this is something that could generate money tomorrow? Yeah, and so now when you're talking about things that are really passionate that that you really care about where you like when you were Building Bebo when time slips away when you have that feeling you care so much about what you're building that you look at the clock And it's 4 a.m.

And you're with your cofounders and you said wow we're really changing the world It's a whole different place there. You're trying to build a brand not just a flip but to literally make an impact Right like so I think you have to look at yourself where you're at in your life Can you take risks like you're saying I know you've been successful? So you have kids you have a family, but it's like can I take this risk? Do I have the right time and do I care about this because it's if I just want to make money right now? Become an affiliate marketer right something like take one of these ideas that you could just easily flip around start making money tomorrow Or do I want to build something long term that is probably much higher risk? But it's something that I want to really put my name to right so the framework I Offer up here is earn learn or legacy which one are you going for right now and at different phases of my life? You summed it up.

Oh my god. I've optimized for different ones. Okay when I moved to San Francisco I told you I just wanted to be near people. Yeah, I decided at that time. I had done two startups already I said next one. I don't want to do myself because you know, I've made these two startups happen with mixed results You know some good some bad I think I've done better than I thought I would do but I don't know what I don't know So I was like this next chapter is all about learning so I hooked up with Michael Birch I was like this guy's done it before he's a billionaire.

He's built multiple successful companies great head of hair great head of hair British accent. Yeah, I can't go wrong and I said I want to learn so I said I don't want to just how can I my thesis was how do I pack 20 years of experience into the next four years of my life? I love that and so I said I got to work with someone who's done it before I got to be around really smart people and I got to work on a portfolio of projects So I get multiple reps and not just one Yeah, and then I found Michael Birch who's done it before and an idea lab or he's working on a portfolio of startup ideas Boom perfect.

Wow. So I went all in. I was like this is what I want other times right now I'm in the earn phase sold by company. I'm trying to collect the check I'm gonna cash in the asset that we sold and collect the check Yeah, of course, I'm gonna still learn things but I picked you know, there are other ways I could be learning more. Yes, I decided this chapter right now I'm gonna cash in some chips. I'm gonna earn and if we look at your earn as well going back to the first question It's you have a portfolio of bets you have you've made your money from selling your company You get paid I'd assume on the first and the 15th from Twitch or however the payment works and you've also made higher risk longer term bets itself That could have a high payout at the end right right and so you have more different streams of income That could be coming in that are gonna help you achieve the long term goals of the type of earning potential that you want to be hitting Right and so if you're listening and the other one is legacy and I've thought about this, okay What would I do next would I optimize again for learning? Sometimes I'll just do little experiments that I know I'm not gonna stick with beyond three months Yeah, but I'm like how hard is it to start a podcast? Do could I grow that this this start is an experiment to just learn I didn't think I'd earn any money off this I didn't think it's good for legacy necessarily.

I just did it to learn And sometimes you know you think about what's a project I wouldn't want to exit from yep It's a powerful question. I have to answer but it's a powerful question. Wow. I absolutely love that That's incredible. And you know what it kind of what you're saying with that earn learn legacy a lot of the work that I currently do It's with corporate still so I work with both like growth stays charges But mostly with corporates and when I help them kind of look at what is the future of the business look like we actually go through a Very similar lens.

It's like how are we gonna make the next billion right? So like what is a horizon to project look like right then? What is the future of our business actually look like and who are the types of people that we want to be surrounding ourselves with? Network startups investors, whoever it might be they're gonna help us understand what that is But not just help us understand and get those insights, but help us build that like that's a lot of the work that I do right now That's cool. I like that. Let's talk about this other idea that you had mentioned last time so Uber driver revenue streams Revenue streams and lift.

You know, I'm neither. We don't discriminate. Yeah, heck. No, I love them both right whenever it's cheaper But for me, I try to think a lot about There are resting assets that are currently sitting idle, right? And so how can you what's a resting asset a resting asset is something like how Uber is scaled because they have drivers that are sitting out there for themselves Or people just driving around that want to make extra income So for Uber for instance, how can we take that a step further? You have people that are online with Uber that are currently waiting for rides and they have when they get someone in their car They have a captive audience There's been a handful of startups that have somewhat helped alleviate this because the big thing that has come out a lot lately especially with some the new regulations coming in is that Uber and lift drivers driving full time are making far less than minimum wage right like far less when you account for all the expenses and the Idol times I think we have the stat here.

What does it say the average pay per hour in America for full time? It's 855 to 1177 on Uber on Uber. Yeah Yeah, all right. Yeah, right in America the average full time for a driver full year 36 525 a year Right, that's that's that's minimum wage, right? And so I think it's no one they're not gonna stop driving. They're not gonna stop driving lift But how can you take something like a Uber or lift driver who for between 7 and 30 minutes has a captive audience, right? So how do you give them a $3 an hour raise? How do you help them make more money? So people have tried this currently interactive media? I think we there's a octopus interactive has done this everyone's seen it.

It's in all cabs in New York It's in a handful of Uber little screen on the back of the chair type thing you play a game Yeah, it's not targeted So you and me are getting in there and I guarantee you if we set in there right now We're gonna get served personal injury. Call me if you've been hurt in an accident, right? Has nothing to do with us, right? Okay, but that's one way one way another one that I actually liked was cargo and it just helps them sell things right snack Little snack bar exactly But to me what I've been thinking a lot about is how do you which is really big obviously the last handful of years? Which is really taken off as personalization So if you think about if you're able to truly partner with Uber think what the type of information they have on you as a rider How old you are your frequent places that you're living even the micro targeting the geolocation of where you are We can make a lot of assumptions about you We could you know Shawn we could probably assume you're you're well off Maybe we can know that you have family or you're currently doing a lot of pools or luxury And so we can start to build a profile around you and with that type of information through like the stereo for instance How could we serve you very targeted direct ads, right? So advertising is one the one that I am really interested in I have a little bit of background in is in the music space And so for me, it's like okay a music label wants to get their new artist someone that they've invested in in front of the Right consumer especially in that first week where they want songs to hit that kind of viral effect Right, and so if you were able to build a music platform to partner with labels and over to actually serve Direct music towards a very targeted audience and you could make money by playing that song, right? I think it'd be a great business.

Yeah, that's pretty interesting because I don't know how many rides there are per day But there's millions of rides per day And so those are all sort of audio impressions Yeah, you could use and if I think if you played ads out loud that would be sort of obnoxious But if you're playing awesome new music You know that could be that could be really interesting where it's sort of non invasive It's actually you know sort of behind the scenes. Yeah, you don't even have to tell the writer Hey, this is you know, you're listening to this because of X It's just this is what the driver has on yeah, and the driver gets paid to have their radio on exactly specifically to a certain station I love hooked into their app because a lot of the time either you're telling them what to change to or they're putting on something You don't like right and so now this is okay.

We think we understand you as an individual So we're gonna try to serve you music that you like right and I'm helping the driver make more money, right? Yeah, I like this idea a lot. I think this is cool Firefly put the big kind of thing on the top of the the ubers Is it is it firefly that raised last week or was it the other one? So firefly raised prior and they may have raised again I don't know if they raised a few drowned prior and like 20 30 million bucks and then I believe Lyft Announced that they were doing this themselves.

So one of the ridesharing companies announced that they're doing this themselves Which is gonna be now interesting to see what happens with that, but I like the idea. I also just generally like the underlying Reason this was interesting to you, which was oh something's changed. So what's changed? Okay, well now we have this fleet of drivers that are all connected using these apps that are on the road all the time That's new inventory that we could do something with new opportunity that that we could do something with and the second thing was Hey, the wages have gone down from making $25 an hour to $10 an hour They're gonna be very receptive to ways that they can get their earnings back up because they're being advertised to that Hey, you're making 25 bucks an hour Yeah That's not your true rate when you take into account everything and if you find a way to make the drivers more money even I bet you I'm just gonna make an assumption here that if uber doesn't get a cut But they're keeping more drivers on the road that they will leave you alone Yeah, they will love you if you find any way to make drivers work exclusively like I think cargo is an exclusive partnership with uber Right, and so if you can help just them like they're their driver retention.

Yeah, I think it really take off Yeah, I like that idea. What else you got? You had some other good ones last time So we touched on Sort of how religion should should be engaging with Gen Z whether it's through the beautiful Bibles or tithing or one of the other Ideas there love tithing. That is what we're gonna call this uber driver radio network, you know We need to hire a brander from our network I have I have one name and it's coming up for our next idea that I've come up with okay Yeah, but besides that all right, so give us that give us that name That's you well You should see a lot of the domains that I own there.

It's just awful awful domains awful domains. I should never be in branding But so the next idea that that I have that we kind of talked about I'm actually talking about it with one of my friends right now, so anyone that wants to join this next idea email Henry B At the hustle go and you'll help connect us. How are you getting blown up today? I'm excited to see how many he gets charge your phone so I'm really big into cloud kitchens. You give a great summary of what cloud kitchens is do you mind? Yeah? Yeah, sure Okay, so cloud kitchens.

I actually know this because I started one way back before this was a thing Oh my gosh, right idea wrong time, but basically it is a restaurant without the physical restaurant, so You now that there's all these delivery apps Uber eats postmates caviar or dash door dash grub hub You just your storefront is a icon in the app. That's all you need you and so there's all these shared kitchens Like just giant warehouses think about it that way that are centrally located in a city But not super sexy locations and there's these giant kitchens that have already invested in all the HVAC fryer's Fridges freezers you don't have to buy any of that stuff you can go rent those by the hour when we did it We paid 19 bucks an hour Wow to have access to this kitchen and so like think about that You know eight eight times, you know 20 20 bucks an hour times eight hours a day that was our restaurant cost So we went from needing half a million dollars to start our restaurant to doing it for like less than five that five grand And we you know so you have this infrastructure.

That's a shared kitchen where normally bakers caterers Food truck guys, that's what they normally use But now you could just run a whole restaurant out of that and you just optimize delivery only and you live on the back of these giant Food apps and you just do pop up concepts, so you could be macaroni only you could be you know fried fried chicken Specialists the grilled cheese specialist You could be like ten different types of Asian cuisine or like the best Pad Thai ever whatever you create these little Micro brands Anyways a cloud kitchen is a kitchen as a restaurant that doesn't exist and delivers off the back of these super popular food delivery apps and so What you just said and you said how many platforms there are? The number one question because whenever you look at starting a new problem or he's starting a new startup Sorry, you look at is there a challenge here or is there a big opportunity? And so With this one I took I looked at myself and I said what is the biggest challenge that these cloud kitchens face? You see how much money Travis Clanix obviously started I bet you he walked down the street and someone else has probably started one Yeah, and I guarantee you the biggest problem everyone has is how do you stand out? How do you stand out as a cloud kitchen because you don't have a storefront? So are you gonna put a lot of money into brand? Right is are you gonna stand out just on your logo or that your keto and you do niche foods? So something that I've been thinking a lot about which I'm calling.

Are you ready for it? cloud kitchens is Influencer based cloud kitchens Okay, and so if you look at the the expansion of influencer marketing and not just influencers as a pay to play Scheme that startups are or large corporates are working with to hawk their products, but instead Actually having these influencers build real businesses look at Kylie. Yep Kylie didn't sit there and build out the formulations herself She put a ton of work into it and like a hundred percent that is incredible what she did But she worked with a brand incubator who on the back end knew the formulations.

They knew how to market it They knew everything behind it and leveraged her distribution her name to make it scale the way they did same thing with how Rihanna did it So what's happening in the beauty space what you're saying is could happen in the food space? So who's a well how would this work? Give me an example. I'm just so in my mind It's someone you can do influencers a handful of different ways if you go on Instagram right now How many different food influencers are there? I mean, I don't know thousands thousands thousands.

Oh, yeah, 10s a week Ella delicious You know all these different ones that like my partner for instance she we own every cookbook I feel like yeah, we own legitimately every cook my wife's vegan So any vegan influencer like I know I know the name Aaron Ireland She's because she sends me every recipe that this woman posts which is a you know vegan recipe 100% I go on Instagram right now I guarantee you I have four messages from her from different food things that we should try right and it will say I eat out too Much so instead of going in figuring out.

Okay. How do I build this recipe? Gosh, I gotta buy I gotta make couscous I don't even know what this is Instead it's like how can you leverage the name of this influencer help them with some of the recipes that they have on their Instagram itself create the menu create the menu and create all these cloud kitchens like across the country or wherever it might be So that everyone can have access to it. I like it. I like it a lot So this is sort of like the Gordon Ramsay. He has several restaurants, right? Like he's got his Bobby Flay has the burger bar Gordon Ramsay has his thing in Vegas and other places I feel like every somewhat decent airport has a Wolfgang puck, right? Yeah, and so or you guys talked about it with Lance Jimmy Buffett.

We're going to Margaritaville. You're somewhere warm And so what is the Margaritaville? What is the Gordon Ramsay? What is that next generation working with these new age influencers to actually create full menus? online just in a cloud kitchen with none of the upfront costs and as you know how high the Churnright is on restaurants itself. Yeah, your startup costs are incredibly low All you need to do is find the right influencer the right demographic build out the menu with them right of things They're already building they have cookbooks You're just giving access to everyone and then you grab off the shelf chefs essentially who can actually just implement and Food on a daily basis right trivial to find people who could do that I really like this idea because I just think it's a really fun idea and there's a lot of times where you have passion Actually, the music one's very similar.

There's all these passion areas that are just garbage businesses. Yes, and this is you know Food is another one where it's like great. You love food Okay, what are you gonna do? You're gonna be a foodie. What does that mean? You're gonna be a food blogger? That's a little bit tough This is actually like a sort of cool novel way and again. It's because something has changed Yes, these food delivery apps have have paid billions of dollars in customer acquisition costs Yes to acquire hundreds of millions of users across the world You don't have to get you like you don't have to pay for the views.

Yeah, you're not paying for the customers They're coming to you. Yes, exactly So I like this a lot and I think you sort of can bridge these two these two worlds really really well So I like to say that my friend has this phrase which is that chefs are the new DJs Yes, that people just the same way people follow DJs now and we'll go to the club where they're at There's this is actually happening in sort of the food world. Look at What's what's that chef or what's that show on Netflix? Open to not open table chef's table chef's table like that.

Oh like that just took off right and so yeah I'm a hundred percent with you. The one thing I want to add is I want someone to do this Yeah, I don't just want us to talk about this anyone that is interested. I want them to email Henry I'm not even joking. We're starting this right. I have someone on the other end that is gonna help with this I'll help it get off the ground right motion to action. I love it and again Literally we did this when we did our restaurant we So we started a sushi restaurant.

Yeah, I don't know shit about sushi I like that I do great. I did it right out of Duke and we found a chef from the Food Network So we saw this guy who did the Bobby play challenge He beat Bobby play at a sushi challenge and he was super charismatic And he was obviously knew his shit about sushi and so we were like oh that guy we need that guy And so we literally partnered with this guy It was really hard to get him to take us seriously because we were 18 years old and there's a whole story about how we did that But we parted with the Food Network chef and we created this this restaurant concept And then we ended up because we just didn't have money We did it as a cloud kitchen Yeah, because we were like look I don't want to sign a 10 year lease with a personal guarantee And that's what I needed to do to get a restaurant space So, you know just getting resourceful we created this thing and at the time there was no Postmates uber eats those didn't exist.

That was the missing piece Wow, we still had to go get customers to come to our website to download to order the food Is this if that had changed this whole you know, I wouldn't even be sitting here. I'd be so running a sushi Is this gonna be your legacy? I feel like we just hit on something I feel like this is next no, I ran away from the food industry because it's tough But that's just I was doing too much too many dishes every night. Oh, that's incredible I love that anyone that wants to do it honestly Henry be at the hustle.co.

I love it. All right So we got a little bit of time. Let's see. See how we're doing on time. Okay. We don't have too much time All right, we have let's say one last thing is there one last thing you want to bring up This is Stu's power hour not the power hour. I have so many ideas. Hopefully you have me back I fully understand I feel like I yell into this mic as much as Sam so I'm gonna apologize everyone to listening Well, we want to bring you back we want to have basically is recurring sort of friends of the house so there's certain people that are Fun and have a bunch of ideas and it's not like when I was doing the interviews before, you know You tell your story once I'm not gonna have you back to tell your story again.

Like that's just too much Nobody wants that but with this, you know every month every two months I want to be bringing, you know our guests friends of the house back as a recurring cast to character So that's the big game plan count me in you can catch me at my desk about 15 feet from here Yeah, but something that I've been thinking about a lot. You're a big notion user, right? I use it I wouldn't call myself a big notion user because I have a love hate with it. Okay, I Have loads so slow for me.

It does load slow. That's like a deal breaker for me But everything else is dope, but you guys made the website. We made our whole website off of it Honestly, it's one of the most powerful tools. I've ever used the hard thing is I tell everyone and everyone knows I am an evangelist of things that I love. I must have signed up 200 people on copper for instance I'm calling people everyone's like what CRM do I use I'm done with I'm like now you get on copper right now I haven't taken any affiliate money for this by the way, right? And so notion is the latest thing.

I'm addicted my life journals in there everything my whole life is in what do you love about notion That you didn't get it. What were you using before? Docs ever know you name it. I was using the whole G suite. I was using obviously copper But I've moved I've actually poured it over a CRM into it because there's a lot of really great integrations I'm using a physical journal itself like you name a sauna and what what is it about notion that got you what got it was the The ability to create it's legitimately a blank canvas where it lets you be the artist towards your own personal workspace.

Oh Yeah deep there If people that are watching this I'm crying Or yeah watching this so but legitimately the hard thing though what makes it so beautiful and What makes it so difficult is that you legitimately just end up on a blank page? Create right and so I think the biggest opportunity notion has and I've tweeted at them so many times and I will continue to Is that they have the opportunity to legitimately create the app store for business templates? And so if you go on notion.so forward slash templates, they have a couple they've about 12, but if you want to become a power user You got to go on YouTube.

You got to find all the right channels Right, and so I think there's a really big opportunity for someone or for notion itself to become an actual template or sorry a Natural platform and an app store to create templates for notion right ready to go CRM ready to go Journal ready to go whatever all the different common use cases that hundred percent I think it's a massive opportunity Like they've raised what 10 million at an 800 million valuation and they have such an engaged community But nothing is tying them together right like people are hacking together templates.

I use it But it loads slow. I can't get out slow. You put in so much information. Yeah, that's probably what it is It's like so feature rich and it looks all right. I like that notion you should pay us for that I mean they actually so they that wasn't an ad read but that was better than an ad read I mean yeah, they did they actually sponsored the hustle morning newsletter today Okay, it has nothing to do with that. I'm not an employee of the hustle right. Yeah, me and you didn't get any of that money So let's let's get notion out here.

All right It's do great. Have you where should people find you follow you Twitter Twitter at Stu Iverson Follow me on there. I put it in the show notes. Yeah, I'm active DM me I'll message you back. I promise you Yeah, that's where you can find me. Nice. Okay. Love it. We're out
