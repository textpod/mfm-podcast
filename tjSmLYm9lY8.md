I have a ton of stuff to cover Thanks for wearing a shirt by the way Did you get all all hot and bothered when I just don't have sleeves man. This this is a shirt Well, I guess so we don't all we don't all dress like you know bouncers at a Miami strip club, so I Do look like that I look like Yeah, I look a little special at today. Do you want to what do you got going on? I have a lot of interesting stuff All right, let's start let's do it All right, did you see everything that I put on here? Well, it changed you had a whole bunch of stuff about Greeting cards and now it's something else buying lottery tickets.

All right. Good for it. Okay. I got a lot of stuff I got lottery tickets. I got mug shots. I got oh The athletic stuff I actually let's do let's do lottery tickets first And then I want to do athletic stuff because you actually talked about that so I just talked to this guy I don't think I'm gonna do anything with it I don't know yet, but I just talked to this guy and I thought it was really amazing now This company that I'm gonna tell you about it has to deal with the powerball and lotteries which I actually think that my Stance on it is I'm like personally not in favor of it.

I I'm not I'm not on board But I thought it was fascinating so there's these companies that are there's two of them in the space So basically the way it works is there's two major lotteries There's the powerball and mega millions and then each state has a state run lottery. Okay. Yep, and The way it works is you go to the 711 you go wherever and you buy a ticket So there's this company that I just started talking to there. They're called spins And what they do is sorry slips spins slips. So you know have you heard of this or you see did I write it down? I talked to them a bunch of months ago and I talked about them on the pottery But I did talk about it, but we could do it again That's okay.

I don't remember you telling me about them. That's okay. Most people probably don't But how did you hear about slips? I? Don't think just like a month like this month. It's been on test flight for a long time. So I used it on test flight Dude, I feel the wind was blown out of my sails just now. I'm sorry. Okay. I'll give you a minute to recover You do explain now because you're good at it. I'll try to remember so basically A lot of people play the lottery typically go to a 711 or a gas station or something you buy it What these guys did was they let you play the lottery from your phone legally.

How do they do that? Well, basically wherever you are You'll say I'd like to buy a lottery ticket and then they will physically go send somebody to a gas station They'll buy the lottery ticket. So it's sort of like there's a task grab But essentially that'll go buy the lottery ticket in person for you because you can't actually buy them online They'll buy it. They'll take a photo of it. They'll sort of custody it online and and give it to you and And so that's how they kind of bypass the rules around Buying lottery like running an online lottery You can't run an online lottery But you can pay somebody to go buy the ticket and then they can give you the ticket And that's like their two step process.

Did I get brilliant? You got it brilliant or you got it right? And I think that's brilliant I think it's brilliant because I never would have thought about that and it's the easiest possible solution and By the way, I think they simplified it even further where they just paid the guy at the gas station to be the task grab it So now they don't even dispatch somebody. They're just like hey when this thing rings That's that's somebody paying you to buy a lottery ticket And you pay like a little premium on top of what the lottery ticket is and that's the kind of like service Surcharge which might be like 25 cents or a dollar or something.

It's not like Percentage wise is pretty significant, but it's not a huge amount of money. So people don't care It's like I smoke convenient because they can I can get a push notification. It says the lottery is $200 million today. Would you like a ticket and you just say kind of like yes, and that's that's low friction I was saying they have subscription. They have a bunch of stuff, but when I was talking to this guy I was thinking there's a few I was thinking of the pros and cons. So Pros of this business. It's gonna get big fast Yeah, I can see it getting big fast.

That's the only pro That's a big pro in the world of business. That's that's the main pro That's the main pro. There are so many things about why it won't work Are you like why it won't work? Are you saying basically like ethically? I have a problem with this or well No, that's just one of the many things. So like I wouldn't say ethically. I have a problem But I would have to ask myself how I feel about that So like I would have to think about it. So in one regard it's like I don't buy the lottery and I don't want like if you Don't have a lot of money.

I don't think you should buy the lottery that said who am I to tell you what to buy? And also if you want to spend I go to the casino and I like to spend $50 and that's fun So like who am I to say what's like who am I to judge? But the second thing I would imagine App like this would have very similar economics or not similar economics But similar growth tactics as like a mobile game, which means you have to be super aggressive about Customer acquisition and if Facebook Google or that pretty much that's it if they ban you you're fucked yes, that's that's a legit problem for this and That might be the big the two biggest what's that? I also I think had some social feature that was like if you and your friend you and your friends can kind of like share it You could split tickets or something like that Like did they do brought all the offline things were like, you know an office pools together and buys a hundred tickets And then they agree to split the money.

I think they brought brought that into it. So it's a nice app I liked the idea. I liked the idea a lot but I just you know, whatever there was a whole bunch of reasons why I decided not to invest but I just thought it was I Think it's a clever idea and I've been looking at this for years So to your question of how do I find this is because for years I've been thinking about how would you how would you bring the lottery online? And I've talked to many people who claimed they could do it legally and it wasn't actually legal or It was only legal in one state to do it that way and they were hoping all the other states caught on And so I've just been keeping an eye out for rule changes and that's kind of a theme Like we talked about the name and the NIL thing for the for college athletes name image and likeness rule change equals opportunity I have another rule change.

I'm gonna do today That's another opportunity, but this is this is an example of one of those types of businesses You want to talk about that and I and I and I L stuff? Yeah, what do you got for it and the reason so you brought this up and I had known about it But I just saw this other article. Did you see this article that went viral about? This Alabama kid hasn't even like Played a million bucks and revenue booked for the year or something crazy like that Well, the funny thing is the coach Nick Saban came out and he's the one who kind of said it So he's like, oh, yeah, you know, it's creates a weird situation like our freshman quarterback He's made seven figures, you know, he's making all this money his teammates aren't making that money.

It creates an awkward dynamic But so some people there's really three reactions to this one is like, okay Maybe there's some truth to that the second is oh is this like for years? There've been all kinds of people who make millions of dollars like Nick Saban does Nick Saban makes tens of millions of dollars as the coach And all the players played for free and it's like dude, you're trying to keep the players down now that they're making a buck You got a problem with it And then there's the third one which is the super mega evil version of this which was he added this line at the end where he goes He's like he's making all this money and that's because of our brand.

That's because he's quarterback at Alabama Which is true it became a recruiting pitch at the same time So he was fake being outraged but really was what they call dog whistling dog Was whistling to all the other you know high school athletes right now and you come to Alabama that check is pretty big This guy hasn't even played yet and he's getting this type of money Imagine what you what you'll get when you come if you come here and so all the other college coach The players were mad at him the coaches were mad at him and the media was mad at him.

I loved it It was a master master stress. Well, I actually did was we contacted I went and contacted some folks in the compliance industry At schools and they made a comment that said they're explicitly banned from finding or facilitating any type of deals For athletes the school is yes. Yeah, so like Nick Saban can't like, you know, they can't be the middleman at all, but What they're able to do is act and so the reason I'm bringing this up is you had this idea where it I mean, I guess it's a fairly obvious thing But you said it well of like you have to have this software or some type of compliant software in order to manage these Relationships and manage these deals and I have an example as to why that's kind of important But so the school can't can't be the middleman But they have to be in the loop about what you're doing the school will definitely pay Which is why I was saying you should build a tool like this with transparency visibility reporting payments infrastructure Because the schools will have to pay and once they pay they're locked in because you're gonna be the system of record of how the athletes are Making money and I want to give an example Let me give you an example of a very very very specific example about why this is gonna get really complicated So, do you know American top team? I bet you do it's that it's a it's a yeah So it's a mixed martial arts gym in Florida They offered five hundred dollars a month to Miami's entire 90 scholarship football players to advertise their gyms on social media So that's five hundred forty thousand dollars, but every player has to do it now.

There's like these crazy There's these crazy rules and so Here's an example An example of the gym deal for the money players we mentioned the contract states that they must advertise for the gym over social media But if they lose track and not and all 90 athletes do not post Technically, that's a pay for play and not an N a n il deal and it's a major NC dot NC double a minor So it doesn't matter if you understand that what matters is that it's incredibly complicated and that this is gonna get like really complicated I wonder if somebody can also just build the other side just build the build the IRS So it's like build the little police the independent police Task force that's gonna be monitoring all this stuff and finding Potential violations and then selling this service back to the schools which is like hey We found some athletes that are out of code here But this is actually against the thing we will sell you this type of visibility so that you guys don't fall out of compliance That's another way to do it is you you diagnose the problem and then you sell them the prescription That line is gonna lead me into my next point.

That's a totally different topic But what when we talked about that when we talked about this NC double a thing did a lot of companies reached out to you Yeah, there was a bunch of they didn't reach out they go bro. We're already doing this. We've been doing this That's what I mean. That's what I mean. Yeah good good for you. Great. I agree. It's a good opportunity I don't know why you got to get all defensive about it any any anything interesting You know, I didn't really look into them because I didn't have time But I think like open doors was one of the ones that a bunch people mentioned I don't know if that's like the number one.

I Kind of think that it's not really gonna be some player that's been around for a while I think it's gonna be somebody I view it as in these markets It's whoever builds this first simple useful thing We'll get a ton of adoption and then it's then it's a race between the people who tried to build the big valuable thing and The group that got a bunch of adoption to go from small and simple to more thorough and whoever's where do those lines cross? Which which group gets there first and I like to bet on the horse where the founders identify it Hey, this is a simple thing that we can get in the hands of every athlete right now or every school right now and We can even give it away for free as long as we get them hooked into ours our system.

We have a relationship with them I think those are gonna be the interesting ones. So I'm kind of looking for who's new But I'm open minded about it I haven't seen anybody make it make a very compelling case that they've got something good going But I do have an idea around this if you're ready for it. So are you familiar with how? Sports agents make their money like if I'm an agent for an NBA basketball player Do you know roughly like how that money shakes out? No So so basically if I'm an agent for an NBA player, I'm gonna take let's call it two to three percent on average And I'm not an expert at this that may be more nuanced to it But this is what I have a couple friends who do this and this is what they told me so They make about two to three percent of the contract value.

So let's say in the NBA like a max guy might make 40 million a year So let's say you have two guys You got a max player and you have his his buddy on the team Who's kind of a bit of a mid level player and you have 50 million they 50 million a year from the team You're gonna make two percent. So you're gonna make a million dollars a year as an agent So you can stack some pretty good money now. It is a absolutely Cutthroat and ruthless business where they're all trying to backstab each other and steal each other's clients and it is like a Slightly dirty industry where there's a lot of sort of like bribery wine you know something on the good end whining and dining and on the bad end sort of like Bribery and shit talking that goes on in order for agents to get clients But I have a few Better tell me about a few friends of his that have an agency as three people and their athletes under contract will bring in About three million total a year and so basically the main guy the main agents probably bank in 2.6

million 2.5 million himself and then the other 500 K goes into like operations of paying the other two people They're kind of like salary. So how much is the total? The contract value will be I think he takes three percent So the contract value was something like 75 million just were rough numbers for the years like four players, right? And so and it's like yeah, it's really hard to get your foot in the door But when you have this guy like typically the players will stick with you unless they have a problem with you You mess up and so you get there like 10 to 15 your career sometimes And then as long as that player has a name you can use them and their Introductions to get like a couple other guys on the team that their buddies with that they trust when they're looking for agents And then they keep going down market.

So they keep trying to get guys like right before the draft or you know in college They're you know showing up on campus and just talking to the guy trying to not create an NCAA violation But build those relationships. So what I was thinking was There's less the general general business. I don't think it's a great business to be in but You know, whatever it's kind of there's a few people that win big and then most people get nothing the Opportunity I saw was well with this name image likeness I think this is gonna breed a whole new set of college hustlers that become sports agents Why is that? because I'm a player at a school if I'm just some kid in the same dorm like I remember when I was on Duke campus I bumped into you know, Gerald Henderson on the first day of orientation and And he actually is kind of a funny story.

He was like we kind of were hitting it off, which is great because Normally these guys, you know, everyone's mobbing them. They don't care about you They're looking for like the hottest girl around that they don't really care about this brown Indian dude What why am I talking to him? But we hit it off. We're joking around and he goes, oh man, like what are you doing tonight? I was like, oh, I think we're going to West campus. I didn't even know what that was at the time It was my first day on campus, but I just said something I thought sounded cool He's like, oh, sick like hit me up when you go like here take my number and I had finished high school in China and so I actually didn't even have a cell phone the first day of college I was like getting my plan set up.

And so I was like, oh, you know, I don't have a phone But he just looked at me like, oh, bro, you don't have a phone and he just like walked away That was the last I talked to him. But the opportunity is With an NBA player, I know I know I blew it. I blew it many many times after that too with other players But basically let's say I'm friends with that guy I could just go hustle I could go to the local car dealership and I could be like, hey How much would you pay Gerald to be on this billboard, right? He's a big name in this college town So you'll give him 1500 bucks.

I could go to Gerald and say hey, dude I got you a $1,500 deal. All you got to do is like say yes and take this photo And then he would be like, oh sick man. And if I did that three more times I'm pretty sure I could be this guy's like business manager within like two months of being in college and If you just plant those seeds at that stage because you're on campus. You're one of them. You could work the scene locally I'm pretty sure that that's one way to like hit your wagon to someone who's a future NBA player and actually become an agent So I think you're gonna find some super agents that come out of this like this one rule change There's some kid who's the next Ari gold that's sitting on Kentucky's campus or Alabama's campus That's gonna end up being like worth $500 million and they're gonna get their start by selling name image like this Like local deals to for the local players.

Yeah, I mean, that's what a lot of people have done with music You know scooter Braun started that way What was his origin story? So I know I know we had a break if you don't know who scooter Braun is he owned this company called Ithaca holdings Which I think just sold to a Korean music label for three or four billion dollars scooter Braun's most famous for yeah, Ithaca holding just sold Is he like a billionaire? Yeah, probably Wow, I tell you Billy you didn't even know about how do you feel brah? I feel great I love how much it's helpful Alright, so he sold it to Hyde which is the Korean entertainment conglomerate that owns I think they had the rights to BTS which was like the biggest yeah, yeah, or something Let's see.

What's the sale price? I'll look it up. You keep talking Anyway, so he sold this company. He was most famous for being Justin Bieber's manager, but he also managed Ariana Grande and a few other people he's only 35 36 37 very young you'll see him in some of the music videos He was also famous because he bought Big Machine Records based out of Nashville which owned Taylor Swift's rights and he bought that for only like 80 million dollars even though it made 40 million dollars a year something crazy like that And he got a start out of Emory University.

I believe and when he was a sophomore Somehow he started throwing parties and in doing so Uh met Jemaine Dupri's mom who owned a record label in Atlanta where Emory is Dupri is that you? Mrs. Dupri is like the head honcho of a of a meaningful like production and music And he starts working for him and he and and the Dupri's and he's like doing this music thing And he's like bringing people all that he's bringing all the kids to college parties as a club promoter and making a cut To like a Jermaine Dupri party and eventually when he's 22 he has a little bit of money saved but not a lot like less than 100 grand He finds this guy on youtube who is a little kid He's like seven eight nine ten years old and he's playing a guitar and he's playing a guitar and he's singing and Scooter goes this kid's gonna be a home run.

He's gonna be a winner. So he flies this kid and his mom down to Uh, Atlanta and he goes, I want to manage you and the kids like I don't what do you mean manage? I don't have a career He goes you're gonna be a superstar one day and that was Justin Bieber and he So he discovered the Biebs and he made tens of millions of dollars off that and then recently made a billion plus from selling his company What did he sell it for? One one billion. So it was one point oh five billion So so just two quick numbers.

So they sold for one point oh five billion and he had acquired that big machine Like label thing with Taylor swiss rights for 300 million back. Oh, okay. So my numbers are off Um rich whatever Um, and so and so let's just go through some more numbers. Bron now holds a 1 stake in Hybe Which is worth 123 million itself the BTS members each have 18 million in in Hybe. So there's seven of them Um, and then Bieber and Ariana Grande have 14.3 million dollars worth of worth of a stake in Hybe Hybe went public at 1.5

billion and has doubled in the last few months I would have bought this if I knew that the company behind BTS had gone public Uh, but I was not I was not awake at the wheel here So kind of interesting. I don't even know how we got on but but he got started in in college promoting Bieber and he also you know who his second act was Asher Roth the guy who Oh, nice and he and at the time he was like this asher Roth guy is going to be the biggest He's gonna be the biggest Yeah, but asher Roth came to him after doing I love college and he's like, you know I kind of like don't really want to be famous like I don't want to like be in limelight.

I just want to be quiet And so he bailed on him Respect So, okay, we should do we should do more on scooter and I'm gonna also there's a billionaire behind BTS this guy like he's amazing. What his name is? I'm gonna do a deep dive on this guy. Uh, bank seahook Uh, so we'll we'll go on to this guy. Let me tell you another story One thing by the way, just one regret I have is that I did not hustle in college I I had like very small small like tiny schemes like I was a schemer I've always been a schemer But I was such a goldfish guppy schemer back then I was trying to like Find a way to win the monopoly game and epic donalds and I was trying to like, you know get into the easiest classes I was thinking small and with my buddies and we started like a sushi restaurant thing But like had I now that I think about it College this four year playground With the whole bunch of potential co founders all around you with a whole bunch of potential customers all around you With nothing but free time and nothing but energy and no mortgage.

No nothing. It's all paid for it's a giant summer camp Damn, that's that was the time to take some shots. Take some experiments. So if you're listening to this or you know Send them this clip. It's also the time to get drunk hook up with girls hook up with dudes Try on different hats and explore yourself. You don't have to have the pressure to like make money I'm not saying become successful. I'm saying Take some shots hustle a little bit and that doesn't mean don't party that means um The way I prioritized things was was just dumb which was like, I don't know sleep number one class number two friends number three you know, I was like I thought I thought college was about the classes and college is obviously not almost almost not about the classes in any shape or form But it but the illusion is that it's about classes and a little bit I want to talk about the fat fire thing that I mentioned the other day and you kind of said something to me But right now or do you want to talk about that now? Do you want to talk about some mugshot shit? I got one other little quick quick college hustle idea There's another rule change to be aware of this rule change came from angelist Angelist made it where it's now very easy for anybody who does any professional investors Anybody like me or you who invest millions of dollars a year into startups We can now make it's very trivially easy to create a scout program to have anybody become a scout for our program Which all that means is you bring a great deal to me if I invest you get a piece of the upside So you get to free free roll into investments and you get to network with real investors and you get to be Basically hunting startups for fun Um, I was doing this but back back when I was I think I've talked about this for the first angel investment I ever did I did as a scout.

I found a deal. I diligence did I thought it was a great deal I pitched that deal to somebody who had money and they were like great I'll give you a piece of the upside And um, and there was no like, you know, it's like we have to figure out our own paperwork for that Well, you know, it wasn't like a easy one click button like angelist has now made it Well, they've had this I've used this for my thing on the back end Splitting deal by deal carry wasn't easy for funds or rolling funds before I think for spvs It might have been but now it's easy for everybody.

So I so if you're interested in investing The game has changed. Here's what I would do my quick 30 seconds of what I would do if I was if I was somebody who Didn't have the money to invest in startups, but I love the idea of startup investing I would contact my four favorite investor. Maybe it's you know, me and the three other people I got four email addresses. So You send an email and you say you don't say, hey, can I work for you? You say hey every week. Hey, I love startups I am a junkie.

I'm always looking for for interesting startups that are on the come up Uh, you know, I'm good. I'm a developer. So I know about that or I'm into music So I'm watching the music scene or whatever right? You figure out what your what your angle is And then you just say I'm gonna send you three interesting startups a week You don't have you don't have to reply But if anything catches your eye or you think it's either really stupid or really awesome I love a one line reply and you just start sending that for three weeks straight And if I don't reply after three weeks, you ditch me and you figure out somebody else But if you do this, you'll walk you'll do two things It'll be fun because it's fun to just check out startups and play that game of fantasy investor But be you'll actually walk away within a year You'll have a portfolio of startups that you have equity in that you sourced that you diligence and that you pitched And that that's like a great way to break into this industry.

So I think angel has just made it way easier to break in I just wanted to put that out as a PSA for people Yeah, and go ahead drop your email Yeah, shon at shodpuri.com Um, all right, so a minute ago you said something that was actually really brilliant And it was about the ncda stuff and what you would do is you would find the violations and go to ncda And or go to uh, like, you know university alba. I'm I'm being like, hey, this is your quarterback Is actually breaking the rules here. The the fines are x y and z Uh by our software for y And way easier sell than by our software It's hey, you have a problem Here it is.

If you if you don't want to have this problem in the future, we obviously we do it. Look, I did it for you already So there's this you remember earlier a month ago. I mentioned the business of mugshots, correct? That's right. You told me about mugshots.com. I think it was yeah And so I went and did a bunch of research on these businesses. There's a whole ecosystem of this So I'm gonna name a bunch of them. So, um, it's let's see. Where are they? Okay, so, um Mugshots.com gets at least 600,000 visitors a month busted mugshots.com

666,000 visitors a month five fine mugshots.com 72,000 visitors a month What is busted mugshots? That's just ugly people ugly much? Is that what that is? I don't know Look at it. The same thing. I think it's the same busted like in jail not like your face is busted Arrest.org 4.35 million truth finder.com 9.1 million and then be there been verified 23 million visits 23 million visits and so these are all centered around Mugshots and criminal records now you want to hear how these guys make money So what they do is and and here's a story so There's this guy Matt creed in Kansas City and he started this company called blabbermouth in 2013 And what he would do is he would post names and addresses and mugshots of local people who had already been arrested Then he would mail them all letters and say We have already been blabbing to the world about your release from jail And we want to make you aware of our services as we kind of have a big mouth and for 200 dollars We will remove all the information from our website And they would send that to people and that is exactly what mugshots.com

does. That's what arrest.com does That's what busted org.com It's free search pay to be removed from the database prescribed from the from from their search Not only that there's a whole bunch of removal services. So there's remove slander.com remove arrest.org Or race mugshot.com who charge one thousand to five thousand dollars to actually just do this to all the To all the companies I imagine what they do is they just charge you five grand And then they go and pay all the websites each like 50 bucks Like they just have some affiliate deal and they just take a little bit of profit.

There's probably some rule There's probably some dmca type rule or if I request to be taken out and you have to take me down That's probably what it is. That's my guess. I don't know if that's right But I feel like you may not have to pay anything. It's just going and filing the claim So in in vast in the vast majority of states posting photos online of These mugshots is totally legal. Okay, so you can't you really can't get a it's not a big deal to post them It's public record where the gray area is is that the websites that populate them They put the mugshots on there and then they turn around like in charge individuals money to remove them Um, then now a lot of these guys who run these websites like mugshots.com

They the authorities are trying to look for anything little that they do wrong Or anything that it doesn't matter how small but they wanted to do something wrong Like for example, like embezzle a little bit of money, which I think that there's like a Figure out if someone is embezzles like you could probably catch that mistake It's like if they don't file their taxes correctly, you know what I mean? And so the founders have actually been locked up for like three four or five months at a time And a lot of these websites if you go and try and find we I went and researched them You try to find out who owns them.

It's different domains in Panama believes things like that It's like this huge web, but it's incredibly fascinating There's this entire ecosystem around mugshots and then mugshots removal and it's a very fascinating very interesting I think it's horrible, but it's interesting nonetheless Tell me you're shady without telling me you're shady and then you post you post your your Cayman Islands Incorporation documents or your believes, you know headquarters address Dan Dan come on come on microphone real quick. You're a good human being I would say Dan is a extremely straight edge human being from what I could tell and Dan tell me this when I hear Sam explain these businesses My literal my first reaction is awesome.

That was wow so smart how they thought of that And I think you probably are like many people have a different reaction which is sort of like Cheese these guys like whoever does this is kind of a scumbag. Tell me Dan. What is your reaction to this? Yeah, I just chatted to you. I said the owners of all these companies are human garbage And so is that your reaction would say I've described these as like gross or is it like Like my reaction was awesome. I mean, there's lots of ways to make money in this world.

That just sounds like a horrible one That's a good point. Okay, fair enough. So I I I do not like I do not like this. I would never do this. I think these guys are pieces of shit and also I think it's amazing like Like I think that like so doing what this guy Matt did of like sending the letter That's like table stakes any schemer who has ever wanted to do that like already schemer out there Who's been like 19 like that's such this is the most this is some basic bitch shit I think this is like the most basic like scam I would imagine but uh, you know I would never in a million years do it and I wouldn't want to be friends with anyone who does it and yet I still think it's fascinating and interesting right, so there's like Would I do it? No Uh, do I think other people should be allowed to do it? Maybe I should know if somebody does it do I consider them a piece of shit or do I consider them like, you know It's fair game.

It's just not what it's not for me, right? Like, uh, I think those are the kind of to me That's like the moral question bar question marks. I get into with stuff like this, but I don't know. I think these are very clever very smart. I think they to me. I'm always like wow It okay. Yeah, I wouldn't do it, but Huh, that's interesting. What like if you just piece it together. There's a bunch of layers one layer is Oh, man, you can create businesses just taking public data That's not really formalized for for kind of like consumers to like use and you could like aggregate it Create a search engine on top of it.

You can create a product there. Yeah, like people do that with People do that with Zillow people do that with many things. So it's just one generic business model type So then you say, oh cool if I ever find other public things that are public record But I don't know that there's a main consumer consumer website for it. I could build that Then there's like, huh, there's some psychology. Why are some of the people? Why are millions of people going to these websites? What is there like is it just like a Gossip thing is it that they are trying to solve some problem like they had some theft and they they wrote down some guys license plate They're trying to figure out who it is.

Oh, maybe there's a maybe there's a consumer problem to be solved here And then there's like the business model innovation or the business model tactic, which is the same thing I was saying earlier about nta violations, which is You don't sell the the search you sell the removal, right? You sell the solution once they search and uh, okay That's interesting too. So I look I look at it as a bunch of different layers and then when I put the whole thing together I'm like, yeah, that's kind of crappy. But like as individual layers. It's pretty fascinating to me It's fascinating you want to talk about porn? Yeah, let's do it.

You saw this thing I wrote down. Yeah All right, so I saw this company that's in yc right now And I don't know how you wait first of all, how do you see all this interesting stuff? That's like saying, you know, how do you pull off that shirt man? I don't know you just do it. You don't even think about it This case this was on hacker news. It was uh, it was posted as a show hn So I check out hacker news when I go to hacker news. I typically will go to the show tab because I find that to be more interesting than the news and And then I think in this case ben sent this to me yesterday when we were talking about something that we were just Bullshitting about something else related and then he's like, oh, yeah, there's another company like this.

That's kind of interesting He was laughing at it and I was like, no, I actually think that's like a legit idea He's like, what do you mean? And I was like, well, I think these taboo ideas. So in this case This is a company that helps people who are addicted to porn Fight their addiction. So it's a great treatment. So it's like alcoholics anonymous for people who are uh, Compulsive with porn and I'll just get you addicted to this app. So he sent it to me as a joke like, um Dude look at this and I was sort of like, I bet that's actually a big problem There's a lot of people who have this problem and I bet there's kind of nothing There's no real legit company that's Occupying that space.

Why not? Why wouldn't there be something that occupies a space that helps a lot of people? And so I started looking into it. So they have about a hundred thousand Members of their community. They say, I don't know if that means just registered people or explain the product. I'm Explain the product. So the it's an overall company that's supposed to help you overcome a digital addiction So it wasn't just for porn, but they started out with a few different products So they had the first one they had was called detox and all it was was a Basically it was an app that would just like get you off your phone for a period of time It would kind of like lock you off your phone and just tell you Don't use your phone for the next four hours.

You're detoxing. Okay, cool. Uh, and by the way, I've I've wanted to do this myself. I kind of made a rule for myself one hour a day. I'm just gonna Lose my phone. I don't need my phone every hour of the day. Um, the next one they created was social x That's your that's your personal rule That's my personal yeah, I didn't know about this app, but I think it's a good thing I didn't know about the sap, but I just I just put my phone in one different room and I just leave it for an hour um Then there's social dude Yeah, that's a lot for me I was constant on my phone, dude me too.

And so what I do is I just uh I don't I yeah, I only use it from 9 a.m. To Six work hours and then I just leave it Oh my god, what do you do for fun? Um, well, so I'm trying I mean, I I you're real killer in your night times. What do you do? No, I guess technically I mean I do have it on me sometimes I just use airplane mode all the time So you just can't contact me like I just won't see any messages. What do you just use it as a clock? Oh, uh, like if I were working out, I'll use headphones or music Right, okay, but that's it.

Wow So after 6 p.m. If I text you you're just not gonna get it Or like you get a instagram comment or something. You just don't look at it No, I don't look at instagram comment. No, no, of course not. No, uh, if you called me Do that the same If you called me I would probably see your number and pick up But if it's anyone else, I'm not like if it's if you're outside the circle Yeah, I'm not gonna talk to you. Well good for you man. That's that's really good. I think that's I think you're saying it like it's a normal thing and and when you say it all out It sounds perfectly reasonable.

I think like less than 1% of people Well, let me tell you this this quick story. I heard about an early night in gale. You know, early night gale is No, what's that? So he's this uh, he was around in the 60s probably the 40s and 50s actually and he was a radio host and he would tell Interesting stories, but he was also kind of business minded So a lot of like he was like the tony robbins of the day and he told the story about how he um went to a farmer's house one time And this was right when phones just got created and he was at this farmer's house I forget what he was talking to him about but the farmer's phone was ringing and it was going off and going off and Earl was just kind of looking at the farmer And uh, the farmer just kept looking at him and having a normal conversation And then the phone went away and then it started ringing again and kept going and Earl finally goes Hey, you know, mister like your phone's been going off.

Aren't you going to answer that and he goes? Why would I answer that he goes? Well, someone's calling you but he goes sir I installed this phone in here for my convenience not their convenience and I don't feel like answering it right and That's now how I uh my opinion now toward my phone is is like no, this is here for me not for anyone else I uh, I similarly I picked up a phrase like that that I'll share that I've been I've been like Kind of playing with I don't know if I'm like fully adopting this because I feel like a dick when I use it but my brother in law I was talking I was talking to him the other day and he's uh, he's a successful guy in business and he was like He was talking about um, I was asking about like a tax accountant and I was like, yeah, my tax accountant's saying this and I'm saying this He goes and I was like, how do you do it? He was telling me how he how he runs his Relationship with his tax account.

I was like, oh, wow, that's kind of strange Uh, like why do you do it that way? I like don't don't they ask or don't they don't they like want you to do x y z he's like Are they paying me or am I paying them? And I was like you're paying them. He goes, okay, so then we're gonna like if I'm paying you Then we're gonna do this a certain way and if you're paying me we're gonna do it a certain way He goes so many times you see people who pay someone for a service And then cater to the other person as if they're being paid by them and I started to see this at first He said I just kind of laughed it off.

I used to do my cleaning lady. I I cleaned my house before the cleaning lady Yeah, I changed my plans for her I'm like Sarah. We are not like I'm not fixing this. I'm paying this woman to do it Right. I think I even said this to Dan the other day. I was like, uh, Dan was talking something about like, uh, the schedule of this Of like our recordings or whatever. He's like, oh, it's getting real late You know because you guys are always like kind of last minute on their deadlines And I just had to kind of say it and I was like, I feel like a dick saying this but I honestly like it's this is again This is the situation Dan are you paying me to record this or am I paying you to edit this thing? Right like which way does it go because right now you're telling me how I need to do it But I pay you to put this podcast out, right? So like Again, it feels like a total asshole thing to say in a mentality But man, it's like been very effective.

I've used this like 10 or 15 times the last two months of just reminding myself What is the arrangement here? Oh Person from the bank is calling me Hold on. Wait a minute. Do you do do I work for you? You work for me. Hold on. Which way does this go? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Now I remember let's do it this way instead Uh, and like fights my kind of like just nice guy get pushed over instincts. Uh, all right. Anyways back to this, uh, app real quick So they have a the main app the one I think that's blowing up for them It's called blocker x and basically you just you go on your phone and you basically set it to Disable your ability to go to adult sites maybe on some timer or maybe just like permanently.

I don't know Let's take a self blocking thing and blocking these sites is actually not that easy Um, and so you want to be able to block this without blocking other sites accidentally And without letting you get through and so you and so they basically have this This combination of things between like a community of people like peers like alcoholics anonymous Like here's a bunch of other people also trying to improve themselves this way. Here's a tool a blocker Here's like gamification a streak or like points you're getting for Continuing on and I just thought this kind of interesting like is there a modern day AA? like If people are right that social media is the new smoking right that um that that all this like kind of like overload of technology overload of digital news and information and social media is making us unhappy and lonely Then isn't somebody gonna build the like AA for that like that kind of makes sense to me even though on the surface This sounds like a weird idea.

What are you so I'm trying to yeah, I think this is great But let me put some stuff in perspective. So I actually use a site like this. I don't use it for porn, but I use it for uh Sure Facebook and Twitter and things like that and so I wish I could share my screen right now But if I go to Twitter right now, it says shouldn't you be busy working? And I use this thing called stay focus stay focus is a Google Chrome extension Yeah, it's a Google Chrome extension. I love it and I just sent it to you according to stay focus The cool thing about doing research on chrome extensions is they tell you roughly how many users they have so they have Roughly 600,000 users, but the biggest person in this space who haven't done a significant amount of research is Research for they have it's called um It's called a block site the thing I sent you it's read out how many users that has Block site is as a million plus how a user crazy, right? Right, so that's pretty good That shows there is a lot of demand because chrome extensions are not like mainstream or like that easy to like find and you know, so if if a chrome extension has a million users That is a strong validation of demand It's huge and so when I look at what these guys are doing, it's kind of interesting So what's it called again? I gotta pull it up.

Uh, how do you pronounce it alt mana? At mana their name is not the best at mana not a good name. So I'm looking at what they're doing. It's basically It starts with a chrome esque Business and then offers more features to get you well, I think there's a mobile app I think that's I think it's the same as what you're talking about but with the mobile app as far as like their go to market And you can see that's actually android. I actually think that's a brilliant way to spin A thing that's already been around And to spin it a little bit differently and I'm on board with this.

I think this is great So the way the way we were talking about um chrome extensions if you go to the chrome extension store You can see how many downloads it has so google play does the same thing So if you click their google play button, you scroll it onto the bottom of any google any app on android You'll see installs and this says it'll say you know either like less than 10,000 100,000 If in this case 500,000 and then it'll say a million this one's at 1 million plus So you know it's between one and I think 10 million is the next cutoff So it's somewhere between one and 10 million installs on android, which again, that's no fucking joke I should invest in this.

This is a good idea and I actually just researched them So they used to be called this thing called fund switch technologies and when I heard that name fund switch I was like I have a feeling that they started exactly how I thought and I went to the fund switches Our fund switches linked in and it said mobile first solution aimed at the uh Getting people Sorry helping millennials overcome digital addictions and helping mental health Sorry, I'm just reading this as we go are aimed at using the latest techniques and mental help to assist people suffering from those digital Addictions basically it was a chrome Ask plug in and they just spun it to be this porn thing because they saw that's the big market to be in So I think it's really cool.

I have a feeling that's what happened I'm just doing all this research like as we're talking but kind of interesting Okay, let's do chrome. All right. So I had this idea while I was laying in bed this morning So by my trainer has me do this exercise. He go. What is it called? It goes, um kegel exercise It's a kegel for my brain Basically, it's a quick like two minute that you do you do in the morning Which is called the events of the day go my way You just sort of imagine your day going the way you want and um, and and it's very simple and and And we do the same thing at night as a revision Which is you reimagine something some part of your day that didn't go the way you want Hey, you just you don't even try to correct it and self help and Ask why what's wrong with you? Why am I such an idiot? You just reimagine it going good and then you go to sleep Um, and this is like such a lightweight mental hack.

But anyways the um I was doing it this morning and I was imagining this podcast going great I'm imagining you saying that is a great idea Uh, and this is what came to my mind. So then the idea came which is how crazy is that? I imagine you saying this is a great idea and then a great idea came on brain within like 20 seconds So here's the idea A chrome extension that pays you for the sites you go to Okay, let's start there. Why would a chrome extension pay you to go to a website? Well websites want traffic, right? That's what most ads are.

So a website. I say I have an ecommerce store I know that a visitor on average the right visitor is worth, you know somewhere between three and five dollars. Let's say Um, just based on the conversion rate and the average order value And so I would be willing to pay a dollar for you to come visit my site So here's what I'm imagining you install a chrome extension. The chrome extension tells you hey Sean Um, ESPN will pay you 30 cents right now to go to their website Um, you know reddit will pay you 20 cents.

Uh, that you know that pets store that you buy from they'll pay you a dollar to come to the site Um, just click the button go there and you just have to be there for for 30 60 seconds or whatever and then you'll unlock the bounty And it'll just go in your little piggy bank right here in the browser. It's a little piggy bank icon Oh, okay. So so I believe that on one side You could get brands To basically buy traffic through a chrome extension and the money goes to the user um Either split with the with the chrome extension or just all to the user in this case And the user goes there and the user says, ah easy.

I just have to go to the site I don't have to buy anything no problem But you go to the site you basically have bought their attention you bought their impression and you know, they may see something new They may convert they may check out some new product that you have because that's what you drove them to Now, how does this uh, how does this end up paying off? Well two two things two interesting things happen here the first Let's say my wife is a big shopper Okay, traffic is going to be worth a lot more than my traffic because i'm a shit each five barely shop I just go look at information.

I steal it. I run away. So I might get low low bids. She might get high bids How does it know what to bid? Well, it's a chrome extension. It sits in my browser. It sees how much I spend It sees what sites I go to it creates a value score for me And so it knows what I'm worth the second thing is When I go to let's say now let's so so so that's the first part It's like page rank but for users users are worth some different amount based on the sites they go to and how much they spend um It's deep it's like unbundling the facebook ad system.

So now the second thing is Let's say now i'm a news website and news websites always want to do this like micro payment thing like they want me to subscribe 1099 a month or whatever, but I don't want to do that But I would pay like four cents for an article I would pay two cents and this idea of like ultra micro payments has been around for a while People want to do this with crypto people want to do this with the different things But if you first did the piggy bank thing by letting users get paid Then you could go to publishers and say hey pay all this for like two cents using that same plug and we have six million members Who um who get paid daily using our thing their piggy bank has money in it All they don't have to put in a credit card ever They can just do like tiny micro payments on their favorite sites when they go there.

So I think you could build a pretty I think you would change the way the internet works if you if you did this. All right Tell me about my idea. Okay. So this is not I don't think new right like the idea of like making a little bit of income from the ad arbitrage and and incentivizing you to go to a I mean this is maybe I was like what would I use today if I wanted to get paid If I wanted to open up my browser and see some offers to make money to go to some of some websites that want me to go there um, you know the penny hoarder The kind of like blog website.

Yeah, they made 80 million a year doing something like that. And so Kind of like that. So they would They would show all the latest deals and all the latest like free stuff that you can get And they would make a little bit of money by sending people there and making that affiliate And so you have to go to the penny hoarder, right? Yeah, so different but same um similar but different correct Um, so there's this guy named dan that one of our friends invested in and told me all about it and he he's like, uh, This is this is a scam.

Now. That's my friend's words. Sorry, dad Don't hold me to this but I sent you a link to it. It's called current mobile dot us um, and that's a similar promise to what this guy made was basically You're gonna get paid for browsing the internet passively and I and I imagine that it was something like we uh, We'll pay you that that ad arbitrage and I'm almost positive that it was like the number one app in the uh, itunes store for like a very short amount of time but number one nonetheless um And I don't know what happened to this but I remember he last raised 40 million dollars But looks like you're thinking that this isn't Doing gangbusters anymore.

He raised. I think he raised 40 million dollars through uh, uh, what's it called an ico? I'm offering. Okay. Gotcha. Yeah, so he's got current token. Yeah, so there's like a bunch of like Stuff around here that it doesn't make sense to me So brave brave browser also has like a similar idea the brave browser has bat which is the basic attention token So you earn it by going to sites or whatever and then you pay, you know, you're basically like advertisers can buy the token to get your attention Uh, you can you can basically like pay the token to like see websites or whatever you gotta be using a brave browser Which is a great browser doing well Yeah, brave browser has like 10 million users or something like so then yeah, this is a great idea You're just suggesting doing it on chrome.

Yeah, I think that's a wonderful idea. Yes Right. All right My my my imagination has has my imaginal act has turned into fact as they say I think that's a great idea, right? I think it's a great idea. That's why I said it. I thought I was excited about it I think I think that somebody could do this. It's like honey, right? Like honey is the chrome extension that basically says cool You just go around shopping on the internet We'll tell you when we could save you money because there's like a discount or a coupon And then they started shoving in like kind of some ad slots.

I was like, hey This person's not even necessarily looking at this product, but you could make him an offer here Um, and so I think that's I think that it's honey, but it's for your foot traffic Basically, what is your foot traffic worth? It's worth something That's a great way to and that's a great way to phrase it Facebook catches all the value google catches all the value of your foot traffic You get none of that value And so what I think is that if you could opt in and say I'll get paid for my foot traffic I'd like to see what my foot traffic is worth You put the chrome extension in you start getting offers You start earning a piggy bank and then that can be used to just either you take the money out Or you can pay for things on the websites you go to and I know that websites will pay for the right foot traffic If it performs and I see no reason why this wouldn't perform All right, let's wrap it up Dan.

Tell us how we did. How was this episode? Episode was good. I liked all the ideas give you a nine out of ten. All right solid
