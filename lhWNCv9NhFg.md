# Behind The Scenes Of $1,000,000/Year Online Courses

Date: 03/31/2022

Duration: 24 minutes, 7 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

I have this student, her name is Danira, and she lives in LA, single mom, three kids, really small house, not enough rooms for everybody. She is definitely doing it herself. She was working two jobs and she was baking and people would come to her house, they'd pick up a birthday cake or a celebration cake or whatever, and that's how one way she was making money. Long story short, cut to creating a digital course and she became really good at caramel candy apples, so how to create caramel candy apples. The thing is, the caramel was store bought.

It wasn't like her special recipe, just people didn't know what store to go to or what to buy, and so she started to create these and sell a digital course. Now, a lot of my students, many of them have made seven figures and beyond, but I want to talk about her because she's a woman who never made over $100,000 a year and now in one digital course launch, she made $260,000 selling how to create caramel candy apples. She literally was just doing live videos in a private Facebook group. I always tell that story because a lot of people listening have never created anything in their life online and they would never even, they're like, my idea can't be good enough or it's not original enough or whatever.

Then I think of Danira, single mom living in LA, making $260,000 on the first time she launched anything, now she's making way more money than that, but that's the kind of stuff that I live for because it has to start somewhere. So Amy, what's going on? So Amy, Portofield, you're part of the HubSpot Podcast Network. You're a newish addition, right? Why don't you join? Right. Yeah, just about two months. And so what would you say you do? I mean, you do, I've read your blog for years and years and years, but we had John Lee Dumas on the other day and I was like, I actually don't know how to describe him.

And he's like, is he, do I just call him a podcaster? Is he, he's a blogger? I'm not actually sure what, how I would like, cause you kind of do a bunch of stuff. How would you describe him? You sound like my mom and dad who have no clue what I do 13 years in. So I totally get it. I always say that I am an internet marketing expert and I help entrepreneurs still build businesses online and my expertise is to take your knowledge and know how and turn that into a profitable digital course. So digital courses are my area of expertise online.

Okay. Amazing. What kind of digital courses? Do you have your own course about courses? I do, which is so meta. I know. So basically here's the thing. Uh, 13 years ago I worked in corporate. I worked for Tony Robbins and I was the director of content development, got to travel the world and work on content that Tony did on stage at like, unleash the power within and date with destiny and all those cool events. And I was in a meeting and I was called so humbling. I was called into this meeting to take notes and I walk into this meeting in this big San Diego corporate office and I walk in and it's a bunch of internet marketers.

Now in my world, these are like the grandfather of internet marketers, although that sounds very rude to, to call them grandfathers, but they're like the Mac daddies. They're with like Frank Kern, Brennan Brouchard, Evan Pagan, Jeff Walker, like big name internet marketers that are still doing really big things, but they were the leaders in the industry. I had no idea who these guys were. And here I am at a side table taking notes and Tony's going around asking them about their businesses and what do they do and how are they making money online? And all I heard was freedom.

Like these guys were running their own businesses, creating digital courses about tons of different topics, and I wanted a piece of that. So that was like my first entry into this world I knew nothing about. And about six months later or so, I had left my corporate job and started creating my own digital courses. So yeah, I've got digital courses teaching people how to grow email lists, how to create digital courses, but ultimately my, my, my mission is to help people leave their nine to five jobs, start their own online businesses. And I believe digital courses is a way to do that.

So that's their vehicle. Sean, you have something to say? Cause I, I, I was gonna say, forget courses. Let's talk about Tony Robbins. I was going to say that exact same thing. I was going to, I was going to say, uh, I was going to ask you about a couple of the people you mentioned, including Tony. And I was like, how much is this empire bring anything? Is this guy just knocking out the park or what? I mean, it's seriously, what I always say about Tony is how have you guys ever been to one of his events before? Have you ever seen him on stage? So I've been to two, maybe actually I've been to, yeah, I've been to two, Unleashed the Power Within's.

Uh, and I'm a Koolaid drinker. I love Tony Robbins. And I, I, yeah, so I'm a, I'm a fan, but I'm also super curious cause I don't know the guy or know much about him. So I'm still a fan after all these years and how he is on stage, like that huge person, personality, all the energy, super intense, like how he is on stage is exactly how he is behind stage as well. I often joke that I might have lost a few years off my life because that was the most intense job I ever had, but I wouldn't change it for the world because I literally got to learn from the master.

Give me an intensity story. Tony Robbins intensity. Well, what you got? So the thing is when, before Tony goes on stage, wait, what? You got to spill the beans. You got to, well, here's why it's intense. Before he goes on stage, he literally preps for, uh, unleash the power within like it's the first time he ever stepped on stage. I've never seen anyone prep for anything and be prepared more in my entire life. And so we have to write these like stage signs of everything that like he's going to talk about and the stories he's going to touch on and they're all, um, handwritten.

I don't know why we would handwrite these things every time, but they're handwritten and he goes over all of them. And then he gets on this rebounder and he's jumping on the rebounder behind stage, getting all the energy in his body, the music, what's a rebounders like a trampoline. Like a trampoline. Yeah. And it kind of gets the energy going in your body and he's reading your stage sign and making sure he's got everything going. And then he just throws the stage sign and he runs on stage and he does his thing. But the intense part is when he gets off, he looks at whosoever in his proximity and he's like, all right, let's download.

He downloads every single time he comes off stage, what worked, what didn't, what we can make better, what he liked, what he didn't like. He wants feedback from everyone. And it's like you are on the entire time. I still, I'm nervous talking about it. It sounds like it. So he's been doing this for like 40 years. That's crazy to me because I went to the two things and he does the same exact thing, right? He does pretty much the same script. So I would assume he's like, you know, knows it by the back of his, you know, like the back of his hand or whatever by now.

So it's not, it's probably not the material that he's like trying to remember. It's like he's just getting himself into that state. What about, what about besides the performances? Because I think performing is definitely like a high intensity thing. What about just like work, like the office or were you not around for that part? Uh, meaning Tony in the office? Yeah, just like on a normal day, non performance. So on a normal day, non performance, Tony's not in the office. He was, when I was there, he was at his house. He did all the stuff from his own house, but he's always on.

So I think one thing I took, what I learned from Tony and I brought into my own business is that one always be prepared, overprepared, care deeply about what you're creating. He cares deeply about his content. So that's why he's always getting it in his body, even though we've done it a hundred times. And when he's not in the office, he's still always, always learning, always, um, meeting with people, learning new things like that meeting that we had. He just wanted to know how they were selling their digital courses online because he was going to start doing that in a bigger way.

So he's always pulling from different places. He was an incredible experience. What about, uh, so Sean, I've told you about this guy before. His name's Evan Pagan. And we talked, uh, we're, Sean and I, Amy are good friends with, um, Craig Clemens. And he was a copywriter. And when we had John Lee Dumas on the other day, I was like, John, tell me about some of these marketers. They're so fascinating to me. And you just named a bunch of them. And I'm going to ask you, I want to ask you about them. But Evan Pagan's the most interesting.

So basically for the listeners, Evan Pagan, I knew him as David Dean. And when I was 14 years old, I was a nerd. I wanted to learn how to meet girls. He had an ebook called double your dating. And what he would do, if I remember correctly, and you could correct me, I think he would, if he would send these really long emails, like it felt like 10,000 word text based emails about how to meet women. And then at the end you could buy like a $14 book. And I think Craig told us that he was selling like $30 million a year of this book called double your dating.

Have you heard about this? Yeah, absolutely. I've heard about it. And I know he's a legend in that area. And when he came to the table, I think he had moved on from that part of his business. But that's how he was put on the map. And the one thing that I learned from Evan really early on is he teaches the strategy that you've got to coin your own content. Like you've got to name it. You've got to put a title to it. You've got to own it. So one of the things that I've always done when I've created content in my own business is like I've got the Porterfield process for outlining your digital course and the sweet spot for finding what topic to create for your course.

I name everything and own it and it sets you up as an expert and that absolutely came from Evan. That's like, so me and Sam both teach courses on Maven and Wes who runs the course platform for Maven. She has one that she calls, she goes like, you need your spiky point of view. I was like, what's your spiky point of view? And she's like, it's a point of view that stands out that not everybody would agree with it. It's like it'll poke some people the wrong way because it's different than everything that they've heard before.

And so that was like the core of when she's like, if you're going to teach a course, you got to have a spiky point of view. Otherwise, your course doesn't really have a sort of angle to it or a hook to it that other people are going to attach with. Yeah, I love that. Do you, the other day, Sean and I were talking about this guy named Sam Ovens because he had this YouTube video called, he has a business called theconsulting.com and he revealed all of his numbers and he was like, we got to 30 million in revenue and then we decided to just be really profitable and we do 10 million in sales with five million in profit with like a team of four people.

And we were just fascinated because that's just like a great, great business to own that. What are some other people who you've worked with or that you know of that are like shockingly, that you would tell people and you're like, I can, you would not believe what this person does. You would not believe how much revenue they make or that they sell a course in this space. Are there any shocking ones like that? So one of the ones that always has shocked me, I have this student, her name is Danira and she lives in LA, single mom, three kids, really small house, not enough rooms for everybody.

Like she is definitely doing it herself. She was working two jobs and she was baking and people would come to her house. They'd pick up a birthday cake or a celebration cake or whatever. And that's how one way she was making money. Long story short, cut to creating a digital course and she became really good at caramel candy apples. So how to create caramel candy apples. And the thing is the caramel was store bought. It wasn't like her special recipe. Just people didn't know what store to go to or what to buy. And so she started to create these and sell a digital course.

Now a lot of my students, many of them have made seven figures and beyond, but I want to talk about her because she's a woman who made, never made over $100,000 a year. And now in one digital course launch, she made $260,000 selling how to create caramel candy apples. And she literally was just doing live videos in a private Facebook group. And I always tell that story because a lot of people listening have never created anything in their life online and they would never even, they're like, my idea can't be good enough or it's not original enough or whatever.

And then I think of Danira, a single mom living in LA making $260,000 on the first time she launched anything. Now she's making way more money than that, but that's the kind of stuff that I live for because it has to start somewhere. What's her course name? How do I Google her? Let's see. If you Google Danira caramel candy apples, you will absolutely find her. So how do you spell Danira? D A N I R A. We call her the caramel candy apple queen. She's got tons of press written up about her. Like she's a, she's a big deal.

How did she get her customers? So who bought this course? How did she go sell? How much is the course? Uh, I can't remember a couple hundred dollars. And the way she got her customers, this is what's cool. She made a lot of videos. She did a lot of social media where she'd show in her tiny little kitchen with not a fancy camera lighting, like what she was doing. And the thing is, so if you own a bakery, a caramel candy apples, like 10 bucks or more to sell, which is really good profit for a bakery.

And these bakers wanted to find more ways to make more money. So she, uh, she appealed to the, uh, small business owners who had bakeries or sweets to sell, but she also appealed to a lot of hobbyists. A lot of people are like, I just want to do that. That's cool. So she had a mesh of two different audiences. But her, she basically just made free content and then sold the course. Tons of free content, lots of videos. Yep. Wow. And so I teach people how to sell courses is with webinars. So she, she started to do webinars and webinars were a way, a new vehicle to sell more.

So she's gone on to do even more launches. You would do a webinar for a three or $200 thing. Absolutely. So back in the day, my very first successful course was called FB influence. I did it with Lewis house and together we created this course and launched it. It was $97 and I probably did 200 webinars to sell a $97 course. And it was a huge success because we had tons of affiliates, but I would do a webinar even for a $97 course. Amongst these internet marketers who, what's the largest course? I don't know, a course info product.

What's the largest business you've ever heard of? Oh, geez. The largest business I've ever heard of. I don't know. I feel like people. Yeah. Who crushes it the most? That's a, that's a, that's a different way to imagine. Well, my girl Marie Forleo, do you guys know Marie Forleo? She has a program called B school. She's been crushing it for 10 years. Here's what's unique about her course. She's had the same course. Obviously she makes it a little bit better every year, makes the marketing better, but it's literally the same course that she has sold for, I think 13 years now.

Once a year she sells this course, $2,000 now it's $2,500. But she's been in the game for 13 years with the same course. That to me is badass because. Yeah, she's probably made like $3 million a year in profit for like 10 years. Do you think that's crazy? Yes, I do. She's very quiet about her dollars. So I don't know exactly, but seeing the numbers, the affiliates, I've been an affiliate for a really long time. Absolutely. She's crushing it. And the thing is, and what I learned from Tony Robbins is you do not always want to reinvent the wheel.

Find something that works, double down on it and stop starting from scratch all the time. And that's literally what Marie is mastered. So she's someone that I've always followed from the get go. Is there anyone else? I'm trying to think, it's just that here's the thing. Sometimes I don't think people are totally forthcoming with their numbers. I've been in the internet marketing space for a long time. And sometimes I trust, you know, what I hear and sometimes I don't. And sometimes people throw out numbers and I'm like, yeah, but what's the profit margin on that? So I always am a little bit unsure about what the numbers really are.

The affiliate strategy. So what, because I think most people, if they're like, oh, I'm going to create my own first, my first course, they wouldn't think that, oh, I should be using affiliate strategy. So explain what that works and how big of a tool that is for you and your like marketing mix. Do you use that? Do you even use that, Sean? Do you use affiliates? No. So I have made millions in my own business being an affiliate for other people, but I've also had affiliates sell my own courses. And to me, I think it's one of the most powerful ways to build a business, at least supplement your income if you have courses and memberships of your own.

So for, I think number one, I think 50 50 is what people should be offering. I've seen a trend recently that it's gone down to like 30%, maybe 40%, 40 60. I'm old school. So I really do believe the 50 50 model is the way to go. And I think that if you find a course that either you've taken or you know, your students will get massive value from it, but you don't offer something like that. I think absolutely adding an affiliate offer to the mix can supplement your revenue. Like I have different streams of revenue.

One of my second biggest streams of revenue is being an affiliate for other people. Who's your biggest affiliate? So I, the most money I, the most money I've made as an affiliate is through Marie Forleo's B School. That's why I'm really close to it. And then Jenna Kutcher and Gabby Bernstein are huge and Stu McLaren, all three are huge affiliates for my program, Digital Course Academy. They do really, really, really well. I think we need to do that, Sean, huh? It makes a huge difference. It's like a whole other stream of revenue. How many people work at your company? So we've got 20 full time employees and then some contractors on the side.

Everyone's virtual. We do a four day work week. And so we work Monday through Thursday and it feels like a big team. Like I feel like that's a lot of people, but I know it's such a small business still. Yeah. I think that's a lot. I've seen so many people. So we do, so I have three digital courses, one membership, and then we do a lot of affiliate marketing. And so everybody is just stays in their lane. And like I've got one person that's 100% focused on my podcast. So that's all she does. Podcasts producer Kylie, you might talk to her, your team talk to her.

And so we have a lot of people in specialized roles. Are you running the company and being the front person? Or do you have someone help them run the company while you're focusing content? Good question. So for seven years, I've had a sidekick helping me run the company. She's a CMO and recently transitioned out as a contractor. So I'm running it more than I normally do. When she's running marketing, I don't have my hands in all of that. That's a lot of work. God damn. Right now it feels like a lot of work, but it won't, it doesn't always feel that way.

What's the name of your podcast? So people who are listening can go check it out. My podcast is online marketing made easy. How big are you guys? We've been, we've been, we're getting in a pissing contest, contest with John Lee Dumas. I'm a little, like I'm jealous a little bit with Jenna. Jenna Kutcher is totally magic. Like she's got an amazing podcast. How many downloads total do you guys have? I think in December on the podcast platform, we had 1.3 or 1.3 maybe million on the podcast platform and then like another 400 on YouTube, 400,000 on YouTube.

Just for the month? Yeah. Okay. Well, that's huge. We had a million in January. That was our recent, was a million in January. So we've had just on podcast players or like, yes, yes. That's huge. That's huge. So we feel good about it. We've had 35 million downloads. I used to not download twice a week. Changing to twice a week has changed things for us for sure. I do a 15 minute one on Tuesday and a longer one on Thursday and that changed the game for us. I'm glad we did that. So your episode was once a week before that or? Once a week before December, I think it was that we made the change.

So then you have way more downloads per episode. So we get between 50 to 100,000 probably average. We have three episodes a week sometimes. So we're doing. Totally cow. That's awesome. I think we even we have four sometimes. So our episodes, the downloads per episode is the more important metric I think. That's the real metric. It's not the one you brag about, but it's still if you actually want to grow, that's the one you care about. It sounds like yours is really big. That's how you are also moving up in the charts. I mean, I know that there's like, you can't know everything about that algorithm, but one thing I've studied enough and I'm competitive enough to know that I'm not moving up in the charts unless my week of downloads are strong.

And so you guys are doing better than I am because you're always above me in the charts. I pay attention to those things. So do we. They don't, I think they're lying. We totally do. I take a lot of pride in the chartable numbers, but it sounds like you get more downloads per episode than us for sure. Maybe in my back catalog, we do. We do a lot of promoting to our own community about our podcasts. We embed it in a lot of things. So we did something really cool in January where we had a quiz and basically you take a quiz to figure out where you are in your entrepreneurial journey.

And then we gave you 10 episodes that are going to help you along that journey. And that blew up. So you're smart. Okay, gotcha. You're smart and you do smart things and then you get good results. I understand now. This is the secret. Yeah. We, uh, the, the, and we'll wrap up a second. The best promotion we did recently was we just announced that we're going to give $5,000 to some person who takes our clips and turns them into TikTok videos and gets popular on TikTok. And we got, I think 30 million impressions on TikTok in like 20 days.

That is incredible. That is super smart. That was the only smart thing we've ever done. His idea was that one. Neither of ours. Ben. Yeah. In fact, I literally called it a dumb ass idea and on air. Wait, is it Ben? Ben just popped up. Is it Ben's idea? This is my chance to come back into the episode. Yes, it was my idea. Shout out to MFM cuts who is killing it and there's many others. I follow them all now on TikTok. My TikTok feed is now just clips of myself and Sam, uh, you know, over and over again.

It's great. That's awesome. Yeah, I'm going to get it out. We, how do I find it? Like I just looked up. Yeah. So here's what we did. But we screwed up or I screwed up. So it's a, what was the hashtag been? MFM shorts. MFM. MFM. All right. So if you go on TikTok and you search MFM clips that with an S you'll find it, but you'll also find, because I read the, what up when we were announcing it, I accidentally one time I said clips with an S and then I said clip without an S.

So if you, if you search both of those words. You'll find, you'll find different ones. And also if you just Google MFM clip, you're going to get porn because it stands for male, female, male. And so you'll get a whole different set of clips if you go to Google. So that, you know, it's something for everybody over here. We're very inclusive. When I was just starting out, my name, I think it was my maiden name. None of that. I think about it. It was a porn star. But I was starting out a ballard. So I think it was someone named Amy Ballard was a porn star.

And I, like 13 years ago or something. And I was like mortified every time I searched my name. There she was. Does that sound familiar Ben? Does that ring a bell? Yeah. No comment Ben. Say no comment. I see. Yeah. That's crazy. The, yeah, that sucks. Definitely sucks. I haven't met you anymore. I mean, I've got a new last name. I used to file this guy on Twitter named Jeff F. And so it could be worse. No, I tweeted at that guy. I was like, ah, brutal name. And then he got so mad at me.

I was like, you can't be, I can't be the first person to point this out to you. Like, don't be mad at me. I didn't do it to you. Oh my gosh. Well, thanks for coming on, Amy. This is, this is awesome. Yeah. Thanks guys so much. It's nice to talk to you. And I know you guys are coming on to my podcast. So I'm looking forward to chatting with you too. Sounds good. Take care. All right. Bye guys. Bye.
