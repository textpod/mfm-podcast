# How To Start An Airbnb Business In 2022

Date: 06/23/2022

Duration: 1 hours, 38 minutes, 42 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

Let's say you have five million bucks. That doesn't mean you should spend five million dollars right now. You should be very good at hosting. You should buy a property, get in the door, figure out how to do it, learn it, love it, master it, be profitable at it. And when you do those four things, then go get your next Airbnb. And if you can do that one more time and prove to yourself that you actually like this, then yeah, go buy whatever you want. Like truly, I don't think there's a right or a wrong answer.

I just always tell people there's just whatever is right for you. So yeah, I mean, I think if you had like five million bucks starting out, my advice is going to be completely different than someone who might have like 50,000. So let me let me like give a quick background of the people here. So it's me, Sam. And then we have Isaac here. My friend, Zach, introduced me to Isaac. Isaac, you I'm going to let you introduce yourself as well. But I like doing a little quick one by myself. So you are how old are you 25, you're 25? You're a young guy.

You got that amazing Mormon energy, although you're not Mormon. And the reason I say that is because Ben, our producer is Mormon, and you guys remind me of one another. But in the last year, you built this property. What's it called? Live Oak Lake, Live Oak Lake. And it's like seven amazing cabins. And you told me it was doing like a million dollars a year in revenue or something like that. And I want to talk about that. But I tweeted out about you and I think it got viewed by like two or three or four million people, a lot of people.

So you both clearly they want to hear from you. So we'll talk to you. And then we have Rob. Rob, I've been I got into Airbnb's because of your channel. So you have like what, 200,000 subscribers? Oh, a little less than that. Pretty I mean, like 180,000. But, you know, maybe in like the next month or two, maybe after this podcast comes out, I'll have 200,000. So you've got this amazing channel. You're like a funny, interesting guy. And now and you have the channels about your Airbnb. So you have like how many Airbnb's do you have? 12, 15? I have, well, you know, I really should count these out.

I have about 15, possibly 16. And then I'm currently an escrow on a hotel or a motel that is going to be another 20 doors. So it's kind of weird. It's kind of weird to just say like, oh, yeah, been working on my Airbnb portfolio for five years and I got to 15. And then in the matter of like one month, I'm doubling it. So hopefully I keep doubling. Yeah. Yeah. The idea is to double a few times this year. I'm working on that. I've got, you know, like 90 to 100 different units that I'm trying to permit from a glamping perspective.

And yeah. And then I'm like partnering up with another guy who wants to scale up to 100 Airbnb's. So we're currently working through that and just kind of the the rapid growth pains of scaling and actual operation. And then you have the YouTube channel and then you're also the host of their pockets, real new real or not new, but you're the new host of their older that's been around forever real estate podcast. And then you've got like your like courses and stuff. So you've got like, you're like, you're like the Airbnb version of Grant Cardone.

Except, you know, that you're not full of shit. Not yet. I think probably in a couple of years, who knows. But for now, I try to be, I try to be me, you know, just as authentic as it comes. I don't really know why I said it in an accent. But yeah, I mean, it's all weird, dude. I don't know. I've been doing this now for about two years in terms of like being a, I don't even want to say the word, but it starts with an I and it ends with influencer. And so like kind of like the whole content creation thing is all new to me.

And then you have bigger pockets. That's honestly, that is something that I still process every day. It's not like, oh, I'm the bigger pocket. So I'm always like, this is weird. It's quick. It's all crazy, but it's all really, really fun. Isaac, did I nail your intro? What did I miss? How big is the business now? What did I miss? That was a good nutshell. Yeah. So we built Live Oak Lake in nine and a half months from start to finish back in 2021, opened in January of 2022. So we're only what five months into this now, five and a half months, but we're on track to gross a million in revenue and about 500,000 in EBITDA.

Nice. And it's opened up a lot of doors, especially since I met you, Sam. That's awesome. And what, and you also, I don't know if you saw this, Rob, but he's got this Instagram page with like 40 or 50,000 followers as well. And all your bookings are direct, right? About 70% are direct now. Yeah. So very early into the process, we opened in January, got an Airbnb, and then like two weeks into it got suspended on Airbnb for no reason. And I knew, I knew direct bookings were going to be very key to our longterm strategy and just adding value to the business, actually making it a business and a brand versus just real estate that, you know, supposedly can make this such and such amount of money as an Airbnb.

And so when we got suspended, I was like, oh, my goodness, like it really hit home. Like you're, they say, don't build your house on somebody else's land. And I felt that really visceral, disturbed feeling. Like I'm totally dependent on this platform. And so I immediately just started, I mean, figuring stuff out, we can get more into this. But ultimately figured out that I was going to need to get publicity on social media. And to do that, I was going to have to work with some bloggers and influencers. So invested very heavily in those relationships and drew our Instagram to, yeah, 41,000 now in about four and a half months.

And so all of the bookings, all the exposure there funnels through to our direct site. So, yeah, we're at about 70 percent of all bookings are direct now. And then the remainder are mainly Airbnb. We have some verb as well. Rob, I take pride in spotting interesting people. This is a good one, isn't it? It is a good one because I have been so very, very anti direct booking up until recently. I'm starting to change my tune a little bit. I just don't. I think it's a very, I think it's a very useful tool whenever you're established.

Like for me, I wouldn't have any worries about myself going to direct booking route because I'm pretty good at putting out fires and stuff. I don't typically advise people to go booking direct, just or direct booking, particularly because like you're your own service representative, you're the trust and safety team, you're the security, you're the people that vets people, you're the people, you're the person liable without all the insurance. And so previously to the past, like, you know, I would say in the past five years of just talking to people, I was like, don't do that.

But now I think there's a little bit of a shift here, a paradigm shift, if you will. And I love Airbnb. OK, I show for them, I talk about them a lot. It'd be nice if they paid me every so often. But but yeah, I show for Airbnb because I'm a big fan of the platform. But I think that this redesign is really shaking things up for hosts. And so I know how to go. OK, so basically Airbnb, typical booking website, right? You can say, hey, I want to go book a place in Joshua Tree and you can go type in Joshua Tree and it will pop populate a bunch of lists of places.

Well, they decided, you know, hey, why don't we break convention because we're a tech company and we can do that? And why don't we? Why don't we change travel as we know it? And so basically they decided to completely redesign it. And they want to basically curate the best listings in the world on the front page of Airbnb via different categories. So they added this whole category search bar at the very top, where you can toggle between different types of houses, right? Like tiny houses, lakefront houses, mansions, desert homes, oh, my God, homes, which are like architectural anomalies.

And so effectively what they want people to do is instead of saying, I'm going to go to Joshua Tree, let's book it. They're going to say, hey, you know what? This looks cool. I've never heard of Missoula, Montana. Let's let's book this place. And they want you to like not go into the website with any like predisposed ideas of where you're going to travel. And so because of that, they're really pushing more aesthetically pleasing visual Airbnb's and a lot of hosts that don't have that are starting to sort of feel the effect of not being boosted in the air.

But they also remove the title. So before it would say like Cool House or like Big Big House with driving range or something like that, you know, like something like unique to get people to click. Now they remove the titles. And so you just see a picture, which sucks, because like if your driving range isn't in the picture, no one will know that you actually have it until they click onto it. And so your click through rate would go down. So yeah, I think they're going to go back to that, by the way. I think I think so.

Here's the deal. OK, I mean, there are a lot of hosts that are complaining like big time right now, Airbnb. There was this big thing where like they used to love the hosts more than the guests. And then they were like, oh, well, we don't make money without the guests. So let's care more about the guests than the hosts. And then I don't really I'm not that jaded. I think it's always been kind of 50 50. But I do think that the ball is a little bit more in the court of the guests now. And Airbnb has I feel like they've made that a little bit more clear.

And so, yeah, I mean, I think. But I think so many hosts are complaining about it that that they've already started to change some of that. I think they're adding titles back in and they're going to be doing a little things. But I would also say that we're just sort of in an odd kind of holding period right now. And so I wouldn't necessarily blame the lack of bookings on Airbnb either. Rob, do you do make more money from your Airbnb's or from like selling courses and being the host of like your digital stuff or Airbnb or like Airbnb or other? Right now, it's other, I guess.

Airbnb I make about I'm pretty open about this. You can find this all on the channel. I make about twenty five thousand dollars a month. Well, it's a little it's a little bit more complicated than that. But I'll say from the Airbnb rentals, I make about twenty five thousand dollars a month net. And that's this month. As soon as I get through effectively like all the funds, I'm raising a fund out in Joshua Tree. That'll be like a five million dollar raise. I just joined Superhost Labs, which is another really big fund that will be raising a lot more money over the next couple of years.

And then I've got this hotel that I'm currently turning into a boutique Airbnb. And I've got all my glam sites that I'm going. So it's like I have sort of paused on single family acquisitions. And so I've dramatically closed off growth in the short term. So I don't really make that much money on Airbnb right now because I've spent the last like year and a half focusing on basically how to get to 200 units. And so as soon as all those pieces start to come into play, that twenty five thousand dollars will pretty quickly 10 X.

God damn. So you. How much how are you doing all this? How big is the team? It is it's giant. It's me and my business partner and my assistant. We're pretty small, scrappy operation. But, you know, I've just been very, very cautious about slow growth and just being happy with like the skill of hosting and everything. I'm like a very good host, you know? And so also like I'm a content creator and educator. So I've really focused more on just teaching people how to start, right? And yeah, I mean, I think now, like I said, I mean, I've got so many irons in the fire that I got to imagine that my team will be like 10, 15 people in the next year.

How about you, Isaac? Is it just you and your wife? It's just me. I've got a big one of nine and one of 10 kids. I've got nine siblings and I used to work part of my background, used to work in the family construction business. We're all very entrepreneurial. So when I was starting in high school, started that, became a project manager when I was 19 and got maybe six, seven years of good commercial construction experience. And so worked a lot with siblings. And now that I've done Live Oak Lake, Live Oak Lake, I actually brought in two of my brothers and my dad as minority partners to also help me with the liquidity I needed and to convince the bank to give that much money to a 25 year old.

But as far as the actual work, it's been just me so far. Yeah, I was going to ask, how did you fund that thing? We spent 2.1 million all in, which it would have cost somebody else quite a bit more because we didn't have a GC or a designer designer. I was both. But basically, we had to put about 900,000 cash of our own money in because the construction loan, the only loan, 80 percent loan to value in the appraisal based off the plans was only 1.4 million. So in 2021, and I mean, this has only continued and only will continue now with inflation doing what it's doing.

The building costs were just skyrocketing and the appraisals. I mean, I think this is pretty widespread across the whole industry, but cannot keep up with even the cost, let alone the value of real estate. So we I got about 1.2 from construction loan. And then, like I said, we had to put about 900,000. But now that's been 12, 13 months later, we just re re appraised at at 3.1. And so refinancing, pulling all of our cash plus 450,000 out. So 12 months later, it's it's a pretty great payback. So if you want to talk cash on cash returns, they're pretty infinite at this point.

Yeah, yeah, it's the the broken symbol on Excel. So are you doing this full time now, Isaac, because you have like an account, by the way, Rob, when I met Isaac. So like I at the hustle, I had, you know, many dozens of employees and I'd interviewed hundreds of people. So I got OK at interviewing people and like trying to spot interesting people and like talented folks when I started talking to him. And he said something to me that just like I was like, oh, you're going to be like the greatest business person ever. He introduced himself or I was like, what are you? He's like, well, I'm an entrepreneur because I have this accounting business.

So I'm an entrepreneur. I'm an accountant and I like to paint and do art. So I'm an artist as well. So I'm an accountant, an entrepreneur and an artist. And I was like, oh, well, you're you're you're going to be a billionaire. I mean, you're just going to be a big shot at it, whatever you try. That's not that special. I'm not that special. You know, that's the three. So I mentioned we all those are like the three really interesting qualities. Well, I had I attribute all anything I've achieved to to my parents and my childhood was just awesome.

But I was homeschooled and so I had afforded a ton of opportunities to explore different things as were all of my siblings. It's not like I'm the overachiever. But yeah, art is actually probably my number one passion. And I'm I'm decent at it. I'm not I think if I did a full time, I could certainly make a career out of it. It's just I don't I didn't want to be stuck doing one thing no matter what that was. I also got into you mentioned accounting. So I started doing bookkeeping. It actually started because I wanted to be able to prepare taxes for other people.

But the reason I wanted to do that was to see how much other people made. I was just very, very curious about that. So yeah, really honest, I love it. When I was like 15, I really started studying on that and then became what's called an enrolled agent, which is basically the equivalent of a CPA. Except it just focuses on tax. It's not the auditing and the accounting aspect when I was 19. And so yeah, I started a cloud based accounting company called Accountable. And that was I was pretty passionate about that for a year or two.

And I grew it to think we have 15 smaller businesses that that we have that we do. Basically, we lump payroll, bookkeeping, tax planning and prep, kind of all these compliance and business admin components together. And then we just charge a fixed monthly fee. And then we automate as much as possible. So it's a really great concept. I think it has a super high ceiling. But yeah, until and then, of course, I was doing the construction. So this project kind of being able to combine so many different elements from the real estate side and the design and the conception to the construction, being the contractor and then interior design furnishing.

And then now all of the management and the software with the systemization of and automations and booking and messaging and all of that. Being able to combine all of those components together has been by far the most fun thing I've ever done. And just being in the hospitality industry, being able to tell Rob. Tell Rob how you set up that automation. So Rob's not going to be super impressed. By the way, so Rob, I discovered you like last August and I just was like, your channel was the number one YouTube channel for me. It really has been ever since.

I mean, I've devoured all your videos. By the way, though, I messaged you the other day. I tried to contact you like five different times, but you just ignored me. So I'm glad we got cornered in the same corner today. But listen, it's not it's not business. It's personal. I'm just kidding. Yeah, the DMs, they're very crazy. I'll put it that way. But, you know, yeah, I don't know. I got to be better about that. I mean, it all started at a like people would hit me up and it'd be like, oh my God, this is great.

Like, but it's I mean, it it's a lot. Honestly, I more so ignore my DMs now because of the amount of people that tell me that there's there's scammers impersonating me. And I'm like, I know, I know, I know, I know. Oh my gosh, it's like 50 messages a day. That's like, hey, are you messaging me from Robolito 77895 and asking me for crypto? I know that I'm messaging you, but is this other one that's obviously not you? You and I'm like, it's not you're messaging the real me. You know, so it's like it's just it's a headache.

I'm trying to figure out how to get the blue check just so that I can like, hopefully you should reply would be like the scammers out there. You should be like, listen, guy, the real Rob would never message you. I'm sorry, guys. I just had somebody from one of your spam accounts just do the same thing to me. No, it's crazy. I feel like I could hire a full and I'm nothing like either of you as far as even my falling. But I feel like I could hire a full time position just fielding DMs from other people.

Just so you know, we won this giveaway. Is this really legit or hey, is it true that you just we're going to send me 10,000 in Bitcoin? Same thing. It's it's nonstop. It's so many. And you and you you squash it out and then another one comes right back up within an hour. But anyway, to answer, I know, dude, and it's like, yeah, no, what Sam was saying, Rob's not going to be super impressed. And I'd actually love to howl with you and I'm always wanting to learn more. And obviously, technology is constantly evolving in this whole space.

But so yeah, so I use host away as my PMS, very similar to guesty and functionality. It's about half the price and isn't quite as great user interface. But I did extensive kind of review with both before choosing that. But yeah, so of course, all the messaging is automated and can be as very bespoke, depending on the type of reservation, which which are the seven units, because some of them are pet friendly, some of them are blah, blah, blah, the lead time. And then I use wheelhouse for my pricing and I've played around a lot with that, trying to come up with a strategy that works well and feel like we're really optimizing.

We're at about 95% occupancy now. But of course, we're doing that by being able to drop down significantly for last minute, bookings and such. And then I have, and so host away has a booking engine feature. So I built my website and then just have a book now, which links to my host away hosted page, where you can actually book, book directly. Now that's a bit clunky and I really wish there was a better solution. It seems to me in the whole PMS space that property management software space, that if you're going to choose one of them, you're either going to sacrifice the booking engine, or you're going to sacrifice some of the core functionality or, you know, in the PMS.

So I'm still trying to refine that. But and then I have smart home. Yeah, I feel that dude. I've been through my fair share of those PMS's and it's always like, which one do you like the most? I'm sure host away is great. I mean, I've honestly, I use all of them. Like I've used them all, I use them all. Guesty for host is my main one. But I got to the point where I like a couple of months ago, I just started wireframing out my own because I was like, well, maybe I should just launch like the best one.

But it's it's a complicated beast to figure out. So are you are you going to do that? I've heard good things about host away. I think that maybe that's a horrible idea for you to spend time on. I think maybe it's going to make you a billionaire because like, dude, because influencers influencers who get into software, not influencers, but like non software people, people with audiences who get into software. It's shockingly tough. And I don't know anything about what you guys are talking about like guesty, like because I have a property manager. So I don't even use any of this stuff, but I toyed around with it.

But it's to me, it sounds like email marketing software, which I know a lot about. And email marketing software, what I always tell people, they go, what's the best one? I go, it's not really what's the best one. It's what's the least worst one that you will like the most. Because like because there's so many specific things that so many people want that they can't possibly accommodate all of it. And so it's just what's the least worst one that you're going to use. That's really what you have to pick. And frankly, they're all mostly adequate and they all mostly have shortcomings, but just whatever you're going to use.

And when I've seen people like start these companies, like start software companies who don't who aren't into it. And they're like, oh my God, customer service is so hard. Or like building every little product is so hard. It's really challenging. Are you actually going to build a software business? Yeah. So I've gone down the rabbit hole a lot because it really honestly comes down to how much money do I want to make? You know, am I cool with making a couple mill a year or do I want to make a couple set of a couple dozen mill or do I want to make a hundred mill or do I want to be a billionaire? I don't really know the answer to that.

But I think that it's very interesting to me that influencers don't do this enough, actually, in my opinion. Because but then again, I don't think that most influencers are capable of doing it. That's what I mean. I think it would only work if you partnered with someone. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. And I would. I mean, it's not like it's not who or not how who, right? And so I've gone down the rabbit hole of what it would be like to create the property management system out there. Because you got to remember, like there are a few like big dogs in this space when it comes to like the influencer and the education side of things.

I'm not going to say I'm the biggest. I don't really know who that is, but I'm up there, I would say. And so I think that if I created a product that I actually liked and it was good. And I said, hey, this is the best one. And I really genuinely believe that because I made made it. How about this? This is not the worst one, but it's the most enjoyable to use. I think I could get some, I think I get some people behind it. I mean, just the affiliates that I send currently to all of the other vendors that I use.

How much revenue do you think you send? Guesty. Oh, I mean, in the past three or four months, I mean, and this has just been through like a couple of integrations and stuff like that. But I would say probably between like, I mean, 60 and 60 to 100 K somewhere in there. A monster or three months. Just like an ad integration over the past three months with like very little promotion. Right. And then like, it is like another one. 60 K and ARR. Yes. Wait, hold on. What's ARR? Define that. Define that for Isaac. I just so he knows.

Annual recurring revenue. So 60,000. Yeah, there you go. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So 60,000 of annual contracts. So that's just through like a YouTube, like a 60 second YouTube integration. Yeah. Then I think maybe you should launch that because on, let's say that you like, take away the last three weeks of markets changing. They're like, it's the common metric that we say is software revenue is valued at, if it's growing quickly is valued at 10 X. Lately, isn't it 10? Is it not 10 to 15? Lately, if you say that we for the multiple number of months, we go back in time six months, one could say that the average was like 20 to 50 times revenue.

So you've sent, oh, guesty. You've sent guesty like millions of dollars in enterprise value. The best, the guy who's done this best. Do you guys know who Doug Demoro is? Yes. Yes. The YouTuber? No. Yeah, dude. Listen to this. Listen to this. The car guy, he's this nerdy guy who reviews cars. And guys like me and Isaac are obsessed with him. If you're a car guy, you like Doug Demoro. I love him. He's great. He's like this dorky guy who wears like shirts that don't fit. And it's like YouTube channel probably makes some millions of dollars a year.

He acts like this like schlep that he. Yes. And he's awesome. And he's got the, and he's probably got three million followers. So anyway, he launched this company called cars and bids. So for all of the car nerds, the car site that everyone loved was called bring a trailer. And it was this really cool website that had a community and it would review and they would like sell it like eBay for cars, but for like enthusiast cars. And Doug was like, screw that. I'm launching my own. And I predict cars bring a trailer sold for like two or $300 million.

I predict that cars and bids, which is Doug's website that he partnered with someone and he started with a, he started with a partner and he launched it three years ago. I predict that that could potentially be a $300 to $500 million company in value in three years. Dang man. That's crazy. Good for him. Yeah. I mean, he probably does all right on the channel. I'd imagine that sponsorship. Well, let's take sponsorships out of it, but three to five million subscribers. Homeboys probably getting like five million views. I mean, I bet you, yeah, he's probably making seven figures on YouTube just on, on AdSense.

For sure. For sure. Yeah. He's just so great. He's a very likable guy. I like his like very simple intro like this is a 1970 Corolla. Yeah. No, that guy's the man. And if I was you, Rob, I would look at him. I would see if I can contact him, but you can honestly look it up on LinkedIn. You could see who his partner was. And it's like a really, I would kind of reverse engineer a little bit about how he's done it. In terms of like being like a face and also having an operational partner.

I think that's like the perfect from what I can tell. And I actually bought a car from cars and bids from what I can tell that is the, it's like the perfect partnership. Yeah. I mean, so that's, yeah. So that's the thing is like, I've gone down that route. I've gone down the route of the kind of the Airbnb metrics and like putting together metrics that I think could be better. And I've also gone down like the another service product that I probably shouldn't talk about. But I just feel like, you know, I've got the, I'm not like the most business savvy person, but I'm like, I'm not like the most business savvy person.

Like far ahead of a lot of other kind of people in the, in the space, I think. And I think, I think I can do it. I think I do. I think I could say, Hey, I've got the best Airbnb metrics website. Use it. And if I did that on all my YouTube channels and I really hit it. Yeah. I think I could get there. I'm not going to ask you why you didn't do this because I think the answer is when you started, you were just like a normal broke guy and you didn't have a lot of money.

Yeah. But now, but I, you know, 20, I, if I, you don't have to say if this is true or not. If I had a bat, I would say you make between one and $2 million just on the digital, the other category, meaning the $25,000 and income you're making from your Airbnb is like, it's, it's small compared to the impact that you've had in general. Whereas Isaac, um, he started with more capital, but he's got this like pretty, this nice little empire going and it's the beginning of something big. If you were to start over again and you had some of the money like he had to start, or the money that you have now, would you go the route where you would go a little bit bigger right off the bat and or have like one location with lots of properties? Or would you continue doing what you did, which is buy like three or 400 or even $200,000 homes all over the country? Um, is the lame answer to say I wouldn't change anything? Is that, I guess that is what you're saying.

No, no, no, I'm not, I'm not asking what, I'm not asking what you would change because that's a, I hate that question because it's like, it fucking worked. Who cares? But I'm just saying like, if you had the, if you had the ability, if like looking back, like your advice to someone, let's say, I mean, I'm asking a little bit for me to say someone who's got the money and like, Oh, I don't mind spending this on that. Or would you still, do you like like having not all your eggs in one basket or do you prefer going bigger? So answers are going to depend on different people.

I think scale accordingly is what I tell people, you know, just because you, let's say you have five million bucks. That doesn't mean you should spend $5 million right now. You should be very good at hosting. You should buy a property, get in the door, figure out how to do it, learn it, love it, master it, be profitable at it. And when you do those four things, then go get your next Airbnb. And if you can do that one more time and prove to yourself that you actually like this, then yeah, go buy whatever you want.

Like truly, I don't think there's a right or a wrong answer. I just always tell people there's just whatever is right for you. So yeah, I mean, I think if you had like five million bucks starting out, my advice is going to be completely different than someone who might have like 50,000. But these days, my strategy is, you know, I've always been a little bit of a sniper in terms of like, I am looking for the property, right? The portfolio piece. And if it doesn't fit my metrics, it's just like, and you know, I've been partnering, I partnered on a recent build with David Green, who's my cohost on bigger pockets.

And he's just like, dude, you're the best sniper in the business, but you need to start throwing grenades. And so I was like, okay, and it's just because in this market, everything is so crazy that it's like, it's true, I can't just be so critical on everything. And it's like, it's a numbers game, I got to put out a bunch of offers and just start acquiring property and get it under there. So for me, I think it's more of a, where are you in life? How much time do you have? If you got very little time, I think the more expensive luxury properties, you should probably focus on that because you're going to like one $3 million property versus 10 $300,000 properties is going to be a lot less work on that $3 million property.

So it's a little bit of a, it depends, but I mean, yeah, I would say start small, scale accordingly. And if you've got a lot of money to throw at it, then scale very quickly, but just first figure it out, you know. I can find this client info. Have you heard of HubSpot? HubSpot is a CRM platform, so it shares its data across every application. Every team can stay aligned. No out of sync spreadsheets or doing databases. HubSpot grow better. Isaac, what do you think is going to happen? So like, you got this thing and it's like, honestly, if I thought of like all the best scenarios that could happen, it seems like you kind of nailed it.

What are you going to do now? So first off, just to quickly recap, because I received a lot of flack from friends of mine when I was building this who own lots of Airbnb's and bigger portfolios and smaller, but basically saying you're investing too much money. You know, this is too much for Waco. You're using too nice appliances. You're using too nice finishes, but the thesis was build something so unique and cohesive and just tasteful and thought through and build an experience around it that you're going to survive up turns, down turns, whatever comes your way and also just have a flexible use space.

I mean, we have corporate retreats, family reunions, all kinds of group events, weddings, and then of course just lots of individuals coming through Honeymoon's, whatever. So I feel like we're kind of... How much should you spend on each unit? What was each unit? I mean, it's hard to split that out, but if you're going to take out like utilities and land and landscaping, just the actual structures, unfurnished, I spent about 220,000 and then there are about 600 square feet each and that was 2021. I mean, and then the record lumber costs, but then... And the land was 200K? Land was 140K.

It was about 28,000 acres. It's five acres and we made the most out of it. I mean, we squeezed everything we could in, but yet we kept them spaced out. I actually saw Rob's... So I had this idea of coalescing for a long time to make this village feel, a little collection of boutique properties, but Rob had a video and I think... I don't know what happened to the project you posted videos occasionally about it, but in Gatlinburg, you're going to do something somewhat similar and so that actually kind of helped inspire me too. I mean, I was already rolling on the project, but definitely was fuel for the fire.

But I had this vision and now, I mean, I think it's pretty obvious just the numbers speak for themselves, but to answer your question as far as where to go. So I want to take that concept and that template. There's tons of things I would tweak both in the construction process. I mean, I have a huge note on my phone of just very, very granular things, even of little things I do differently and in the user experience, but I want to take that concept and replicate it in other uniquely personalized and themed, maybe similar, different design, let's say, if you're in the Southwest, you'd have more of a Santa Fe look, but I'm definitely a fan of minimalist architecture, keeping it pretty modern and clean, definitely appealing to my generation.

But I want to replicate that and all over the place and find markets specifically where I think, like in Texas, I bet we could do another five or six of these and Sam, you've got something somewhat similar that you even have in the works a couple hours away from me, but I mean, just around the Dallas Fort Worth area. So you've got millions of people stuck in this metropolitan area and now hundreds of thousands more flooding into Texas and Texas isn't naturally that beautiful of a place and they have to, and it's also a big state.

So they've got to drive nine, 10 hours to get somewhere really pretty. So if you can create something within one to two hours that really feels like a different world, which is what everybody says when they come here, you're going to be, it's going to be crazy because a lot of these people have, this is the middle to upper middle class, they've got money, they don't care about spending more, they just want a need experience. I think as time goes on, people are only going to prioritize experiences over possessions more and more, regardless of if there's a recession or not.

And even in a recession, people are going to go instead of overseas vacation, they're going to take staycations closer to home too. So they're going to get away for a few days. So I want to find markets just like this one. And I think Texas has several more outside of Houston, outside of Dallas Fort Worth, and then plenty of other places too in the country, maybe even Maine where the land is cheaper, lower regulation. That was a huge reason I was able to build this so fast is because I didn't have to deal with tons and tons of red tape.

I'd much rather pay, you know, lots more money for the land as long as I, you know, I think it's very, very important to plan ahead and look into the zoning. I've had so many people say, oh, I had the same idea or I started out with the same plan. And now they're literally having to sell their raw land that they've held or whatever, because the zoning wouldn't work out. They had to get some permit that took two years and stand in front of 10 city councils and have three Karen neighbors as Rob would call them.

Karen's the Karen's. Anyway, how much did it cost? How much did it cost? I saw what I saw what your property looked like when you bought it. And it was like, meh, it was like nice, but it was now it's amazing. But like when you bought it, it was only okay. How much did it cost to make it look that beautiful with that lake? So it had a road. Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, it was a jungle. It had the live oak trees, hence the name, which are kind of like the flagship tree of Texas.

They're hundreds of years old, they're beautiful. And it had like a muddy, muddy puddle of a pond. But yeah, definitely saw the potential. I mean, we, we took a bunch of trees out, we I had our arborists come in, I was there every single day where it's hard to quantify how much it cost because the whole the beautification process, actually most of it happened at the end, obviously, as with any project, even with the landscaping and all of that. But I would say just as far as like the land improvement, you know, leading the utilities out, I probably put 200 K into just basically taking the bare bones of what we had there with the land and turning it into what it is now.

Yeah, that's not bad. And a lot of sweat equity too. I was out there. Yeah. With a chainsaw. Yeah, yeah, man. I think the permitting is definitely something that's overlooked. I am working on my Tennessee property still. Permitting is a, it's like a little bit of a boys club to get permits out there and like you got to be there. And yeah, so it's, I think actually, I think we just got it. I think we have like the final permit we need. But since I live in Houston now, I'm like, well, I don't have to rush it so much.

But I want to do it. I mean, I want to build, you know, 10 tree house, geodome tree house type of things or whatever. And I agree. I mean, I think people are looking for, for the experiences to travel to. And I'm kind of curious, did you ever make it known or rub it in the face of all the haters that that gave you flack for it? Were you ever like, Hey, by the way, I'm trying to keep a low profile. By the way, I never had that conversation. Is that a landline going off? Do you have a telephone? No, so I'm visiting family and I'm borrowing their office and they have a landline in here for the company.

It's a little backwards, but yeah, sorry, I keep having to mute it. Super frustrating. Answer it. I don't know. Answer my first million. I don't still have landlines. But no, Rob, I'm sorry, go ahead. I try to keep a pretty dude. Answer it. Tell me. Answer it. We're on a podcast. Next time they call. Please put them on speaker. Let's give them some publicity. I'm trying to keep a low profile. You know, I think in the long game, I'm still, I'm still young. This is still young. I have pretty firm conviction and that it's going to continue to succeed even if we have to drop rent.

Here's the thing, even if, goodness. Hello. I'm on the middle of a podcast. If you wouldn't mind calling back, that'd be great. Thank you. There we go. Thank you. I love it, man. That's really great. So are you sure you're not Mormon? Why do you keep asking me that? Bro, is this not the most obvious thing? I'll tell you what. You look like wood. So you look like me. You look like Ben and we look like Mormons. Number two, you dress wonderfully. I could. No, I'm Catholic. I'm from the Midwest. I don't have Mormons there.

You're so polite. You've got 10 brothers and sisters. You're pretty good at business. You're checking off all the boxes. I am a Christian, but I'm not a Mormon. Anyway, back to the things. Here's the thing. If the market tanks and the tide goes out and we're left to see who, whatever. I feel like even if I have to raise, I don't feel like I know I've done the math. Even if I have to drop rent 70, 80%, I'm still going to be at least making my loan payment and then some. So I feel like, you know, like I said, I'm trying to tread lightly.

I'm not into retaliate. I'll tell you who I did retaliate to. So I tried two different banks before I found the one who would give me the construction loan. And they both wrote me off. They both said, no, even with my dad as a guarantor who has plenty of financial stability and liquidity. So when the project, I didn't mention, I also built a $750,000 spec house in five months during this project on a property nearby and sold that and made like $250,000. So when, and this bank refused to do both projects with me. So when I sold my closing day with the spec house and then also when we were wrapping up the Live Oak Lake project, I definitely sent a bit of a retaliatory email.

I was nice, but I basically said, Hey, this is what you missed out on. So that was kind of fun to do. Nice. Well, let's take this moment to let him know, dude, what's his name? I'll be nice. I'm not going to go. Dude, you that's crazy. What if you just left the phone unhooked? That's a great idea. That's a great idea. It's just busy for a long time. I've got a few. I've got a few. Do you, what do you guys think about the like at my, so my property, I bought my place. Have you seen my place, Rob? Yeah, I saw you on the Cody Sanchez YouTube channel.

Yeah. So it's who's blowing up. She got creator on the rise the other day. She did. I'm so proud of her. What's that? YouTube. So YouTube basically picks one person every single day to feature them on their homepage for 24 hours. And it, you know, there's 356 people get chosen for this out of like the millions of people that try to start a YouTube channel. This was for me, I was actually named creator on the rise about six months into being a YouTuber. And that day really changed my life in a really cool way. So I'm really happy for her.

Wow. Well, good job, Cody. She's one of my very good friends. But anyway, the property, so I paid 1.6 for it. I didn't overpay, but I didn't get a deal. It was very much market rate. And we built a gym in it. And so I've got to go and take new pictures of the place. But it's doing okay. It's paying the bills, but just barely. And I hired a property manager because I live in New York for half the year and I'm in New York now. And I was like, shoot, I just got to hire a property manager now and like eventually maybe I'll self manage.

But I, you know, in order to move quickly, I need to do this because I got a lot going on. But anyway, it's going okay. I'm nervous about the recession. I'm nervous about how I'm gonna like, I'm not nervous about how I'm gonna make payments because that's no big deal. But I'm nervous that I wanted it to like make payments for, I wanted the revenue to pay for itself and make a profit. And I got to figure out what the hell I'm doing wrong. But are you guys nervous about owning these assets when well, shit feels like it's hitting the fan now.

But are you guys nervous about having a large percent of your net worth, maybe not liquid? Not, not particularly no. I mean, look, dude, I think, well, first of all, my prerogative has always been to not pay myself from real estate. So whether my return is 10% or 20%, it's kind of like, well, as long as I can sort of be at that 10% range at a minimum, I'll be happy. I've never really been at that. I'm usually kind of 20 to 50% returns. And so for me, it's like, regardless, the way I see it is regardless, if I have to take what I consider an L and have a 20% cash on cash return, that's still going to like, it's going to be the only place to get a return pretty soon.

Like you're not going to get a return from long term rentals. You're not going to get a return from stocks right now. You're certainly not going to get a return from crypto. So the only thing that's happening right now is perhaps hosts aren't going to get a 30, 40, 50% return like the golden days, but they might still get a 15 or a 20 or maybe a 10, but at least they're still getting a return compared to other asset niches in real estate. And so am I worried about it? Not particularly, but I am lucky enough to have diversified enough that it doesn't hurt me as bad.

And what I mean by that is I don't really put all my eggs in one basket. I've got 14 or 15 listings across the country. None of them are really in the same spot. I've got one in Joshua Tree, a couple in LA, Scottsdale, a couple in Arizona, actually. I've got a couple in Texas. I've got one in Texas, Wisconsin, a few in West Virginia, one in Virginia, several in Tennessee. So I've got all these markets to pick up the slack for each other. And so I always tell people to diversify for the seasonality because we know that regardless, even in a recession, people are going to travel.

They may not go to Disneyland and spend $8,000 on like a crazy vacation, but they might hop in a minivan and drive to the Smoky Mountains. And so for me, I'm not I'm not stressing it yet. I don't think I don't think we're I don't think we're at the end of times, I guess. Dude, this freaking Airbnb that I have, it's bothering me. I look at it. The I look at the here, I posted the link in the chat. I was going to send it to me. Can I break it down in front of all the break it down, please? I look at my stats every day.

And like I said, I hired a property manager because I was hosting the podcast. I was in the middle moving. I was like, fuck it, man, I need someone to run it. I think you actually make the real money by not doing that. But I'm okay. Yep. Not definitely. Because I mean, you're giving up 20% of your revenue. Totally. I made that sacrifice. Go ahead. What do you say? Right. Well, you need to watch more Rob Bill so you know, so you can learn how to self manage. But dude, I did and I saw you do it.

And frankly, I was still intimidated. I mean, what's the worst thing that's going to happen? Someone's going to say there's a clogged toilet and you know, hire a plumber to come out and unclog it, you know? All right. So right off the bat. Can I just really can I get into this? Dude, I want you to end fucking Isaac, whenever you get back, I want you guys to destroy me like destroy. Destroy like how much I paid for it. If it's just a totally if I just messed up entirely, I got zero ego about it.

Okay. So I guess my question is it looks like you took professional photography, but your main photos a little pixelated. Those are the Zillow photos. I have a problem. I've got a photographer coming in a few weeks. I just had I wanted to finish my gym. Okay. Well, spend the spend the money on the photography twice. Just get it done, dude. When people are like, Oh, why isn't my listing performing? I'm like, did you take pro photos? And like, no. And I'm like, come come speak to me afterwards. Because I mean, your place is really cool.

I don't think there's any issue with it. You've written it. You've given a very clear indication of what you're getting from this property titles. Nice. I mean, some photos are kind of pro because they're screenshots from Zillow. But yeah, I think get high like your first photo isn't your best one, by the way, like that to me, it doesn't mind what like the square crop. You that photo is a square crop photo that Airbnb uses in their interface. And you're using a like a wide for it. And thus, I don't really know what your house looks like.

And so if I don't know what your house looks like, I'm not going to click it. If someone is finding you on the air on the Airbnb homepage right now, that photo looks like that. And I guarantee you that every single person that's being served up around your Airbnb looks nicer than that. Do you want to know why I change with why I picked that photo? I picked that photo because I used I went to like, mechanical Turk or some website and I paid like 500 bucks and they pay people to like click through on a picture.

And that one that one had the highest click through rate. But did they show that photo in a square setting? Because that max I think the photo would be great if you could zoom it zoom it out. Looks like it's maybe a drone photo zoom it out a bit and include some landscape around it. Yes. All right, what else? Yep. That's my now. I mean, do you have a hot tub that that's always a helpful thing. So Sam, I'm going to go ahead and just read to you what else read the text that I already sent you because you asked me this because I think it's valuable.

This is my perspective. So I'm just going to read it. The barn dough, which is what this house is, it's a barn dominium. The barn dough seems pretty half baked. I think outside of Texas, by the way, I don't think anyone knows what that means. The barn dough seems pretty half baked to me. And although I realized that there can be a benefit to being each, you're going to be limited in the segment of guests that want to stay there no matter what you do to it. I agree with your plans to add more units to the property from a financial perspective.

You talked about adding some cabins, some geodumes, some teepees. But I do question the level of care and design that would be necessary to make everything work together in a cohesive aesthetically pleasing way. It seems that there are some quote, good idea components, gem container strewn about on the property as it is, along with a big shop and box looking barn dominium. But I'm not sure they are really going to come together in a cohesive way. You need an all caps experience that people are going to feel passionate about. I use that word because that's exactly what they feel like when they come here.

It's an immersive experience with awesome, artistically crafted details that work together to create something truly unique and special, something they want to come back to over and over again, something they will not stop talking about to all their friends. That's exactly why we have, that's a big reason for why we have compounding success, whether it's social media, engagement, repeat bookings, direct reservations, word of mouth or all the above. Now, obviously that doesn't get to what you can do to it now. I think there is stuff you can do to it. But I think that was more aimed at the question of, is this where I should be prioritizing my time, my energy, my resources, or should I be doing something from scratch? But no, I definitely think it could be further optimized.

But now that Rob's back, he can dive into it. I think your place is cool, man. I think you have a photo of it zoomed out. Just swap it with that. So at least we know what we're getting. That first photo, or that, I think it's your one, two, it's your third photo. It shows like the sunset and it's like a drone shot and it shows that you're on land. Immediately, that's a lot cooler to me than like this really pixelated close up shot. So you'd be surprised, man. Small little things like that can go a long way.

I don't know if you have instant book on, but if you do, you should, if you don't, you should turn it on. Really? Yeah, definitely. I mean, that's going to make a big difference like through and through most of the time that has, that has ramped it up pretty quickly for me. So few little optimization things there. I think you'll be fine. I think my revenue in May, let me see, dude, Airbnb, it stinks at figuring out how much revenue versus book. Like it's hard to figure out how much revenue I made in the last 30 days.

You know what I mean? Do you use a third party like a property management system or anything like that? Because they will pull up some of those income reports for you. So the shitty part about the way that I have it set up is that I use, like I don't get access to Guesty because I have a property manager. I don't actually get access to that. You know what I mean? Oh, okay. So it kind of sticks. Well, okay. Let me tell you what you can go to your transactions earning as well. And it'll lay it out for you.

But don't you have to add it up and shit? Like because I show you like individual transactions. No, no, no. If you go to like, I think it's like, let's go ahead. Sorry. Tell me. Tell me. All right. If you go to Airbnb.com slash transaction history, I'm pretty sure that's the website. You can go and click your actual listing and then it'll show up and then you can click the date range. So just click it from like May to May and then it'll show you what you made that month. Yeah, it was like 22,000 because I had some April stuff bled into it.

But I imagine revenues in the 10 to 15,000 range. And what's your note? That's okay. No, what's your like your mortgage? My note bill. So I got to go look at that to figure out what the exact number is because it's my insurance. I just got new insurance for it. So I got to figure out how much the insurance is. But I got really expensive insurance. That's quite expensive. But we're looking at fixed costs of around 7,000. Oh, seven to 8,000 a month. Okay. So you're making twice that on Airbnb? So far in May. Well, June sucks to June.

So far has is June is looking like it's going to be a $6,000 a month. So far. It sucks. Well, that that that happens. I mean, I got to imagine you're out in Fredericksburg, I think, right? Am I allowed to say that? I don't know. Yeah, that means you're Airbnb. Okay. Yeah, you can say it's in Fredericks. Editor. Editor, bleep me out. I don't know. But that's probably not the the high season there. So that's the thing with seasonality is like we're on top of the world when we make a lot of money. And we're in our lows of lows when we have to like pay money out of our pocket.

For reference, my house in Scottsdale, I just bought a $3.25 million Spanish mansion, 6,000 square feet. That mortgage is $17,500. And I had to pay every cent of that last month because we had just launched. We didn't have we were getting it ready. This month, finally, we have some revenue coming in. I think we'll probably be at the $10,000 mark. And I'm going to have to pay $7.5,000 out of pocket. And then next month, we might break even, but I might still have to pay a couple thousand out of pocket, just trying to get to October through like January, because that's when like the real good stuff is coming in.

So, you know, I would take a look at seasonality out there. And like, if you're in the slow season, it's it's expected that you're not going to make as much money. Are you going to shut your business down, Isaac, your accounting business and just focus on this? I already did. I just sold it to my business partner. Nice. Cool. That's fun. This is your... I want to chime in on that on that last question though, about seasonality, because like in Texas, we're we have it's similar to Fredericksburg as far we're much less of a destination market.

And that's why a lot of people were raising their eyebrows like, why are you putting this in here? Because people aren't coming to Waco. Although, there are actually a lot of people coming out for like Magnolia. But I feel like if you really look at this holistically and you are willing to invest in creating this brand and the social media following and putting out content, then the whole point of this was to be a destination rental that people know about from all over the country, all over the world, and will come and base their stay just at your property, not even in your area.

I know that sounds far flung, but I feel like if you can create a property like you have, Sam, you've got what 15, 20 acres? Sam M. 20. Sam M. 20. I mean, with 20 acres, you could put a lot of stuff in there. I realize having a lake helps, but I feel like you could really smooth out the seasonality and in general just boost occupancy by investing heavily in social media. And this is something that and branding, and this is something that I don't think enough people are doing. I've had so many people ask me, how did you grow so fast? And the truth is you just have to work at it.

I've probably given away 30 nights, which is easier for me because I have seven units. That's whatever, 2,300 nights a year. So I've probably given away 30 nights to giveaway winners, to photographers, to bloggers. I've probably spent about $7,000 just in bloggers that will post, travel influencers that will post giveaways, but I mean, I've garnered $200,000 in the last three months just on direct bookings. So I mean, tell me which course direct bookings you're making 15% more roughly than on the other OTAs. There's no data wall between it with the customer. You can't get D platform.

So tell me that's not worth it. So I think a lot of people, they really would look at this holistically and actually invest in a property that's unique. And I'm not just buying the average Joe single family home, which I know a lot of people know this is nothing profound, but they really would do this. This is what I would recommend, even if you only have $50,000. Rob, I saw something you posted the other day about a treehouse, with somebody had a treehouse on their property and you were just recommending, finish this out and put this on Airbnb.

Make a cool space like that. I know that you're all about that. And that's why I was reading that text. I was so emphatic about really creating a unique experience. You're going to iron out the seasonality of it. Yeah. Yeah. I agree with all of that. I mean, also, like if you're hurting in June, like imagine, look, this is what I always tell people. And then I'll leave you alone about this. Imagine I love this just punch in the face if you want. All right. Imagine spending $1.6 million. All right. And then on that $1.6

million, you have to bring $320,000 to the table. You've got to bring another $50,000 for furnishings. And let's call it another, you know, $5,000 for like miscellaneous things. And so you spend, you know, we'll call it like 400K, 400K to get this amazing Airbnb. You're like, my God, I've done it. This is the one. This is the cutest little croissant in Fredericksburg, Tennessee. And then someone's like, Hey, you should get professional photos. And you're like, I don't want to spend the $400 twice. All right, bro. You're right. You are actually totally right. I'm going to.

You see me writing this shit down. I'm writing this shit down. You want to know something interesting? And I'm going to ask you about this wrap when I tweeted, I've tweeted out about my property. And one time I tweeted out and it got 3 million impressions because I just used a good picture and I just said my Airbnb is live. And guess how many bookings I got from those 3 million impressions? Zero. Not one. Is that crazy? So when I, it was nothing. So when I book, when I, like, I thought, because I've got, so our podcast has about, let's say 2 million downloads a month.

And the, my Twitter has 150,000 followers, maybe. And my Instagram 10 or 12 ish. I was like, Oh, dude, this is easy. I'm going to like get so many bookings just from posting cool pictures of it. I haven't gotten one. How many bookings do you get from people who are just fans and go on your YouTube? I imagine a lot because I bet you have a lot of big LA contingency and they're, they're willing to go to Joshua Tree. Yeah, that's really hard to answer. I wish I could directly attribute some of my business to that.

I mean, it's hard to say because when people book, it's very rare that they say, Hey, I'm a, I'm a big fan. I can't wait to stay here. So it's hard to directly link some of the bookings from that. Occasionally people do mention it. And I have had guests that have mentioned it like after the fact, but I don't really ever have a lot of people that are like, Oh my God, I saw this on YouTube. I'm excited to stay here. But I have had some people do that. So I would say that most of my business is organic, honestly.

And that's the thing. I mean, I had this like country singer. So I had this country singer like a week ago. He like hit us up on, on, on Airbnb. He's like, Hey, man, I'm a country singer. I've got over a hundred thousand followers and like, you know, can I stay here for free? And I'll give you exposure on my, on my Instagram, you know, we'll bring you some leads. And I was like, Hey, yeah, sorry, we're not going to do that right now. Thanks. But I'm, yeah, we're not, we're not good. He's like, Are you sure? Because like every time I do this, like people get a lot of bookings and blah, blah, blah.

We're like, Yeah, we don't want it. We're a mom and pop. Like we make our money from this and that and blah, blah. And he's like, Oh man, I don't know. I think you could really use it and blah, blah. I was like, with all due respect, I am an influencer in Airbnb. And even my stuff is not going to cause anyone's listings to pop off. Go look me up. And then he was like, right in the chat who it was. Well, you're right in the chat who it was. That's crazy. But that's the exact opposite of what Isaac did.

Isaac had like Shelby Church, who I'm a big fan of. And he had like interesting people. Yeah, but Rob, I disagree with something. He said it crushed it. Okay. It's a dip. If there's a difference between with all due respect, you've got an awesome following. I'm one of your biggest fans and very engaged YouTube subscriber. But there's a difference between your following, which is investors primarily and probably a lot of have knots that want to want to get into the space. And some random country singer or some, you know, random actress or some, somebody that actually has a following of just average people that will actually want to come in book.

I feel like there's going to be a greater percentage of following of their following of some, some, you know, one of those type of celebrities slash influencers that would actually want to come book. And especially if you were to utilize a giveaway. And that's what I tell these people because I've done the same thing. I mean, I've had some real duds with some of these guys that have come out and I just threw my money down the drain by giving them a free stay because they're posted nothing. But if you leverage their following and say, Hey, do a giveaway, you got to follow my account, you're going to get, you're going to grow.

Now, maybe you don't need that or whatever. But for me trying to grow, you're going to gain all kinds of followers. And every time that happens, I have a huge injection of direct bookings. Well, I don't disagree with what you're saying. I think maybe you made it. I think maybe you made a mistake, by the way. I think this guy, he's not that famous. I'm looking at him, but he's, but dude, these country singers, like, you know, like the type of people who follow a country singer, they feel like their culture is being beaten against them and all this shit, you know, and they like band together harder than everyone.

If you would have done a giveaway with this guy, they'd be like, Oh, I don't know, maybe he's not that famous. So he's not famous enough that he should have been pushing for that. That's the thing. Okay. There's a couple things here. All right. So it's like, I don't disagree with what you said, Isaac, but it's like, no one is going to go to West Virginia because of this guy's post. And then I also like looked at it's like easy to see when someone buys their followers, which is absolutely a whole nother soapbox that I won't even do it.

But he's got like, he was doing something with another account. And then so this one's got like 56,000. And if you just look at, he's got 56,000 followers and all of his likes are like 200, 300, 400. And I'm like, he bought his followers. No, no, no, no, I'm all in with you. Once you can confirm that they're a fake have nothing to do with them. That's the biggest waste of your time to even message. So he gave it like a fourth chance. He gave it a fourth shot. And I said, tell you what, my my son's first birthday party is this Sunday.

Can you come and play a set at his party? You know, there's going to be a lot of friends and family there that can give you some exposure. Maybe you'll get a couple of a couple of concerts out of it. And you know, if not, you know, all good. And then I said, just kidding, I'm just busting your chops. But hopefully you see my point. And he didn't respond. I was like, come on, that was funny. Oh my God, that's awesome. Do you that's like the bum on the street who says you're like, that's like the guy who's right outside the restaurant and says, Hey, would you please just give me 20 bucks? I'm so hungry.

And you're like, no, I'll actually take you in there and buy you a hamburger. And they're like, no, no, no, no, just give me the money. No, no, no, no, no, no, just take the money. Yeah. Yeah, I always offer. I used to do that. And I would when I don't drink anymore, when I used to drink, I would do that all the time. Because I'm like, hell yeah, let's go in. I'll get by you anything you want. And the guy goes, do they have for local? I go, I don't know. Come on in. And come on in.

Let's go see. And he goes, Oh, they only have fruit punch flavor. They don't have grape. Thanks anyway. And he turned me down and he didn't he didn't buy it. And so anyway, the we do so you got rid of your business, Isaac, Rob, you make a lot of money from your business. The thing that I've been figuring out with my airbnbs or just with this airbnb business is how much time do I focus on actually building a business like a tech or so I previously built this thing called the hustle, which I ended up selling for tens of millions of dollars.

And that is where the majority of my money has come from. And I was like, Oh, that's cool. I built that to an eight figure exit and I started it with nothing like $5, you know, just a mail chimp subscription. That's pretty amazing that I'm able to create wealth out of nothing. Should I continue to go and build businesses that cost nothing and create value from from nothing or be a real state person, which particularly in airbnb, it's part investment, but it is still part company running. Isaac is very clearly doing that. Rob's clearly doing that.

How do you guys think about where you're spending your time building a company that makes enough cash flow so you can afford to buy all this stuff versus just optimizing and continuing to make the operations of your real state business better? I mean, first thing on my mind is like, yeah, if you made tens of millions of dollars off of an exit and let's just say you are able to make millions of dollars every year from your other income sources, you got one really big problem in your life, like one really big problem and it's taxes and how not to pay them.

And the best way to not pay taxes is to buy more real estate and basically run your cost aggregation studies and bonus depreciate and accelerate all the depreciation on your real estate that your tax bill can be zero. I think when you start mapping out, I know all about that. Can you explain what that is? Okay. Well, first of all, I'm not a tax person. I'm not a CPA. Go seek out professional advice. But with that said, basically, when you buy real estate, you make money more than just the actual cash flow. There's several ways you make money from real estate.

Okay. You're going to make money from the cash flow. That's kind of like the on the nose low hanging fruit. You're going to make money from the appreciation right? And not super tangible, but when you leave, when you sell that house, you'll make money from that. You can make money from your debt pay down because you're building equity in that property. So that when it does appreciate and you sell it, you get more of it. And then also you're going to make money from your tax savings, your tax deductions. Now, ordinarily, you would only be able to depreciate part of your property every single year for 27 years if it's just like a regular residential home.

But because it's a short term rentals are considered commercial, I think it's 27 and a half, but whatever, talk to your CPA about it. But when it's a commercial property, which short term rentals fall under, you can only depreciate it 39 years. Like, sorry, you divide it by 39 years and you get a little bit of your depreciation every single year. But what you can do is you can run what's called the cost segregation company. Sorry, a cost segregation report where you hire an engineering company to basically tell you how much all of your stuff will depreciate.

And they do all this fancy like engineering stuff. And they basically allow you to kind of have this like formal number of the exact depreciation that your property will take over the next 39 years. And then you can go, you know, and claim it on your taxes and take that paper loss on your property. And if it's such a big loss, depending on how big of a loss is, it can possibly offset some of your taxes who I was sweating through that whole thing. But there's one major downside on that. Okay, hit it. Yeah. So basically for my property, I did a cost segregation survey, I paid two grand on my $1.7

million property. They said we can do a roughly $250,000 or $300,000 in savings in year one. Amazing. But there's one big thing that you didn't mention, which is a perfect be a real estate professional meaning, wait, what? Yeah, yeah, the recaptured tax. Yeah. Yeah. So you have to spend again, I don't know anything. 750 hours a year. Yes. And that's actually not hard to prove because and they actually like make you track it by hand. But they if they if you have income through other sources, they go, whoa, whoa, whoa, if you're spending $700, $700 hours a year on this real estate, how do you make it all this money through this other stuff? And it particularly if you have a W2.

So and so I mean, that's a pain in the butt. That's a challenge. So the real estate professional thing. There are a few ways around that like real estate professionals one way to calculate like how you could take I guess I think it's like how to turn them into active losses. I don't really know the exact terminology, but there's like a few other categories that you have to fall into. And a few other like stipulations, they're all hard. I mean, regardless. But yeah, I think for you at your point, it makes sense to go down the route of considering that because you know, it can save you tens of millions of dollars over the next like decade.

And then there's also recapture tax, which if you take your losses and then you sell it, you're gonna have to pay back that depreciation that you took, in which case you'd have to go and buy another property, do the cost tag again and keep kicking the the tax can down the down the road. But that's we're getting fine doing. Yeah, we're getting close to the point where I'm like, I don't think I know much more than this. But I, you know, we can have a conversation. So go back, go back, go back, go back to the main the main question of how are you guys focusing on business building? Because Rob, you can actually build a big business now because you have a following and Isaac, you used to have a business and I have a feeling you're going to be a very good business builder.

That's what you choose to do. But getting outside, you're getting cash flow to keep continuing purchasing assets versus making your real estate business good. I mean, I plan on doing on scaling both. I really like my interest in building businesses are all around short term rental specifically. Isaac, funny enough, I was in the midst of acquiring slash buying into an accounting firm and it was actually called accountability, really, which is like very close to your name. Yeah. And we were going to be a short term rental focused accounting firm. I ended up not buying it.

My buddy Kai bought it and it's great. They're still doing the short term rental focus thing. But for me, I really had to think about it. I actually talked to Ryan Pineda who opened a tax firm and I was like, dude, I'm thinking about doing this. And he was like, let's chat. I was like, what's up? He's like, it's harder than you think. And I was like, no, how could it be that hard? And then he talked me through it and I was like, got it. It was going to be difficult. So now, honestly, Sam, where my solution to like, should I start a business or not really comes down to the question of, can I be a super affiliate for this business and make almost just as much money? And so for like accountability, I'm just an affiliate for them.

And I get a really great cut for them for my actual CPA. I affiliate for them. And then like for Airbnb, I affiliate for them. So for me, it's like, can I just build up a lot of affiliate income that sort of scratches the itch of what I want to do? And like, you know, like, guesty for hosts and price labs, all these people I affiliate for. And so I'm like, I think that's kind of the main question I asked myself first. And this actually goes into like my big business model for the upcoming year.

I'm getting my real estate license so that can be a bonafide realtor. And I'm effectively going to be starting a YouTube channel that's focused on Houston real estate. And instead of doing the real estate work, I need the license to get a referral. I can't get referral fees from realtors. And I've referred tens of millions of dollars of business and I haven't made any money from it. So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to be get my license, start a YouTube channel. And when people hit me up for leads, I'm going to connect them with people that focus on short term rentals across the country.

And I'll get a cut from that. But in Houston, all of the Houston leads that I get, I'm going to give to like an apprentice or someone who's like, like super passionate about the transactional side. And so it is a business that I'm quote unquote building, but I consider myself, I'm going to be like a super affiliate for realtors across the country. And I think that's probably a little bit of a smarter choice to go on most things for me and my platform. What are you going to do, Isaac? You're raising a fund maybe. I'm all in this concept right now.

I mean, I'm only 25. So who's to say I won't be doing something else. I've already started probably 10 different businesses from the time I was six. Most of them were profitable, but not all of them. But no, I don't see why you can't combine the admin and systemization and marketing aspects that I so love about business, whether that be this accountable business or my lemonade stand when I was six or whatever it was with the real estate component, which is Rob Rob said has so many incredible benefits of appreciating value if you're in the right market of tax benefit, which by the way, with the cost segregation, the big, yeah, okay, so most people can't qualify for the real estate professional.

But like, I mean, especially in my shoes, I'm in the most ideal category to benefit from the cost segregation because I'm either going to have 500,000, well, probably more like 450 after you take out interest of net income I'm going to have to deal with, or I'm going to write the whole amount off times two or three years down the road just because I have so much I can, I can take. So I don't need to necessarily dip into my other income. This is my main income for one. But just being able to and even with your at where you're at, Sam, I bet it's going to be tremendous if you were to really stack it up next to where you would be without it, the savings you're going to have.

But anyway, the real estate component with the business component kept coming together, I want to create a brand like branding and marketing is probably the most passionate interest I have and but being able to especially being able to bring all these components together. So yeah, I want to raise a fund potentially but build a brand and I can the thing about this is I mean, as far as growing this without even raising a fund, because I can build these for cheaper than anybody else can because I'm doing everything myself and I realize if I were to scale I'd have to hire some staff and everything hire people.

Yeah, yeah. And I realize that's that's probably a lot harder than I than I even think it's going to be. But I can refinance these and we'll see what happens in them, you know, the overall environment with interest rates and and banks and everything. But at the current rate, I should be able to refinance, pull all my cash out, maybe not even you know, maybe I won't be able to pull out more like I am right now, but maybe I will and dump it into the next project. So plus then you have this building snowball of profits.

So yeah, I want to create I want to go big with this and create a national if not global brand of properties based on this concept, very tech enabled, automated, efficient. I believe you will do that. I invested and I think I believe you when you say I don't believe a lot of people I believe you in particular. Have you seen Wander W A and D E R Wander I invested in them. They raised money from interest and Horowitz. I have a feeling Isaac that you're going to build something like that, but not that niche, but like, not that particular industry, but something similar to that.

I could totally see you having like this really cool brand. Are you going to start a YouTube channel, Isaac? Because I think you should. That's my big question. I want to pick Rob's brain about it, but I've been trying to like do it right now. Right now. This is it. This is your moment. So many people like one, I want to ask them YouTube questions too. Yeah. So I've had so many people just say, Hey, can we pay you 500 bucks for an hour of your time to console? And that sounds really appealing me. And now I'm sure that there's that's going to run out at some point.

Just people could even based off the exposure that that one tweet got me, Sam. And so I'm kind of in this predicament of like, how much of my time do I want to prioritize on creating and being an influencer and actually having a personal brand, you know, coaching slash consulting, it'd be similar to what Rob does, but it would, it would probably, I'd have to find, but my niche was, I think particularly where I feel the most just my gut feeling without doing it. And Rob could probably speak to this really well, but I feel like the most opportunity is going to be in creating, monetizing some kind of course.

Now, I think you probably have to have both because if you don't have the platform and in the audience, then you're not going to have enough people that want to sign up for your course. But so I'm like, you're confusing, you're confusing the two things. You just said that you should do like consulting or consulting is not a business. No, no, that's right. Like a job. Yeah, that was you to YouTube. It YouTube is you make you can you not kind of, but you can make money in your sleep, you know, but you still got to keep making it.

Exactly. And you can scale. And that's what I'm saying about the course. Now I realized there's probably a lot of one on one time. And I know Rob has host camp. I'd love to maybe I'll join host camp. I'll go through it. But, but regardless, if I do any kind of educational endeavor like that, it's going to be eating into the time and the energy that I would also be pouring into this company. And I could potentially, you know, use both if I were to build one more property like that, it'd be a great like live Oak Lake, I could film and make so much content off that process.

So it's something I'm still considering. But and if I do it, I'm going all out like I am not going to do something halfway. Sam, you said something like that the other day on the last pod, but I'm going to hire an editor. I'm going to do everything. I'm going to make the investment because I want something that people I've learned that with just the marketing experience with live Oakley wants something that actually can stand on its two feet. And that I realized YouTube is probably going to be harder than every other platform, but there you're also going to have the most loyal base.

Anyway, that's rambling to answer the question. I don't know yet. I'm still weighing the two of them and I really want to ask Rob. I mean, Rob, if you had to do it over again, ask him right now. You the course like host camp that you do, which I'm assuming my gut tells me you're probably making or you have the potential to make the most money off that in the most efficient way because you have to keep cranking out videos every single week. You've already created this course, but it probably wouldn't live without your YouTube channel, right? I mean, they kind of all evolved together.

So do you feel like you have to sustain both of those things or if you had to do it over again, would you prioritize one over the other? No, definitely not. I mean, YouTube feeds the machine. It's like, yeah, I don't have to make a weekly video for host camp. But I mean, my YouTube channel is the funnel. Like I for the first time, I made them like $13,000 this month on YouTube. Half of that goes to like editing and everything. But overall, like I think my first year of monetization, I made $70,000 on YouTube.

Pretty good. But most of that went to my editor, right? Yeah, but you're building up this super old following. I mean, that's that's awesome. Right, right. No, I wasn't. No, I'm not even mad about that. Like my intention with YouTube is fully to break even even if I make $200,000 a year this year with all of my affiliates. Well, no, let's not even take that. Like this year with brand sponsors and YouTube money, I should be closer to like $175,000, maybe even $200,000. We'll see. Like we'll say like 150 conservative. What about with affiliates? Oh, with affiliates, like $400,000, $500,000 probably.

Yeah, I make I make. How much are you paying your editor and how much were you paying your editor early on? And where did you find them? And what do they do for you? And how does that flow work? Thanks for asking that. Yeah, so yeah. So, so basically when my editor is a good friend of mine, we interned together at an ad agency and we just we worked together. I think it was like 2012 or 2013. And we always just kind of casually kept up and we were like, what's up, man? When I started posting content, I would always like post my my timeline.

And I would always be like, I hate editing. And then one time he was like, man, I'll edit for you. And I was like, really? I was like, I don't think you want that. I'm awful on camera. Like I do so many takes. It's like, dude, I edit for casinos like all the time. And this is going to be such a good break for me. And I was like, okay, cool. That was his full time job casino editor footage, all that stuff. So basically, I was like, well, how much for this video to edit it? And he was like, this one for free.

All right, let's just do for free. I was like, I mean, sure, let's say if you're sure, I'm going to take you up on this. And then he edited my video. And it was fucking amazing. It was so good. Sorry, I'd cuss out. I assume I've heard you cuss on here. I assume it's okay. But basically, like, we watched my video on me and my wife on the couch that he edited on YouTube when it went live. And then afterwards, he was like, whoa, can he just edit for you like all the time? And I was like, excuse me? Yes, I'm gonna ask him.

And so I texted him and I was like, dude, what would it cost to get you like just to get editing for me every week? And he's like, I'll do it for like 20 bucks an hour. And I was like, okay, yeah, I was like, that's fine. That's gonna break me even on YouTube. But it's so worth it. And I was like, let's do it. And so about a year, what was your nut? Oh, but you're you're you're you're making a little bit of money to pay him a little bit. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And so then basically, after I think about six months, you know, we were just getting really serious about the channel.

And he was like, working like he was editing for me. And then my buddy, your friend Andy on on YouTube as well. And like, we were just like, man, let's get you out of your job. Like, what's your number to get out of it? And he was like, oh, it'll be, you know, I'll give a range. He was like, between 50 to $80,000. Okay. And I was like, all right, cool, done. Quit your job. And so he's been here for about just across the one year mark of him being my full time editor. And we actually have to talk about how much he's going to make.

I'm going to give him a raise. You know, he deserves it. And he's the foundation of Rob. I got a question anybody who watched Rob built knows Caleb, the editor is a very integral part of the videos. And I feel like you even like you even told YouTube to put Rob built and and Caleb on the platform for 100,000, right? So I've wondered about this, this very question, like at what point, if you become, you know, if you become whoever, if you got 5 million subs or whatever, you become a real celebrity, you can you can find an editor, you're gonna have people wanting to work for you.

But while you're growing, this is this is something I've wondered, because like, how much loyalty do you feel like you have or how much incentive or buyout do you have to actually give him like profit sharing or publicity to make really great videos for you, which is a huge reason for your success. So that you're not having to turn over editors or look for a new editor and change your stuff, whatever, it just seems like it definitely having that long term relationship built in is extremely important. But I've just wondered how much incentive you have to give him to do that.

So this is very interesting to hear. Caleb's listening to this. I'm scared. I'm like, dang it. He'll always be a part of the team. Yeah, he'll always be a part of the team. I mean, look, my goal in life is to try to make everybody in my circle that who wants this a millionaire. So I don't really know what that looks like for every like for my business partner or my assistant or my editor. But that's my goal. I'm like, if you want to be a millionaire, let's freaking figure out how you're going to become a millionaire.

So right now he's getting paid like a pretty decent salary, but he's up for a, you know, like he's up for a raise for sure. He deserves it. I want to give him that. But even then, like I still want more for him. You know, I still want more for him past what I can even pay him. And so I try to like, you know, I'm trying to get him to buy his first Airbnb and I'm like, let's partner on this Airbnb. I don't partner with really anybody like I can show you the ropes that can help you be like a millionaire in real estate.

Like that's my hope for him. And then I think, I think his big thing for me was like, hey, I'm going to do this. But when you become like Logan Paul big, like you got to give me a raise. And I was like, fair. So I'm not Logan Paul big, not even close. I'm like one tenth or I'm like one 30th the size I think. But right now I mean the channel, it's kind of a break even for me with his like salary and everything. So I think there will probably be like a profit share component of even played around with just giving him like the YouTube money.

But then that's like so hard to track and everything. But I do want to I want to get them up to like a six figure salary in some capacity. Pretty soon like we talked about actually when I first was releasing host camp and lamp camp like doing a percentage on that. But everybody was like, no, you don't want to do that just like pay him. And I was like, all right, cool. Sometimes I wish we had just stuck to that agreement because I think that would have probably fixed the fix the money issue and stuff like that.

But yeah, man, I mean, I don't know. There's I think I will be working to incentivize him. I don't think he wants to go anywhere. I think we want to grow this thing together. And he's like a very loyal and a very diligent worker. And like those are really hard to find. And he's also a really, really good friend, like a very, very good friend. Like he's who I text literally more than anyone on this earth, including my wife. So but I think look to go back to your initial question, it's like start a YouTube channel, start consulting, consult for as little as possible for as little of a time as possible.

Because no matter how much you charge, let's say you charge $1,000 an hour, the most you can make on that is like $2 million a year or something like that is the most you're ever going to make. I was consulting, I was charging 150 to start. And then at the very end of it, I was charging like $500 an hour, I was booked out a month in advance, I was taking four or five consultations a day on top of my full time job. And then I quickly realized like, oh, I can quit my job and just do this.

I make five times the amount of money in like one fourth of the time. And then I got tired of answering the same freaking question every single day. Oh, I want to build a house in Joshua Tree. How do I do it? What do I buy in land? Do I need power? Do I need to grade the land? Like where do I get the plans? How does a draftsman work? How does an architect work? How much money is going to make? And I was like, oh, this is really hard to do every day. It was amazing for the first six months.

I'm really grateful for it. But what it did is it primed me for I started knowing what questions people were asking. And so then I was like, oh, I'm going to create like this, this program, the six week program. And I called it Glamp Camp, where I taught people the fundamentals of starting a glamping program. And then that was super successful. And then I ended up starting host camp, which is like my Airbnb program where I teach people how to start Airbnb businesses. And yeah, that's a seven figure business for me, like the big time.

I plan on fostering that. But all of that happens and that all works and it all makes some money because of how much time and effort I put into the YouTube channel. So while I only make, let's say 150 this year, not only, but while I make $150,000 this year on YouTube, I'm going to 20X that in host camp this year. And so every YouTube video that I make, every single joke that you see, every single edit, every single smile, every single word is meticulously edited every single week for every one minute that you see of the raw built channel.

It takes one hour to edit. So if you see a 30 minute video, it's a 30 hour edit because we take it really seriously. And I'm not super huge on YouTube, but I that's my baby. Like that will always be the thing that I love and adore and put my time into because the more time that I put into that, the more seven figure opportunities will arise from it. Are you filming the stuff yourself or is Caleb with you and who's writing the video? Or who's writing, who's come up with the ideas and writing the script and things like that? Me, I write all the, like I just have a notepad of like things I feel like talking about.

If I'm feeling bummed, you know, I'm like, all right, why I'm bummed as a millionaire. If I'm feeling rich, it's like how I spend money as a millionaire. If I have a bad day on Airbnb, it's like how this Karen ruined my day on Airbnb. If I made a lot of money on Airbnb that week, I'm like, how much money I made on my tiny house in Joshua Tree. It really just depends on how I'm feeling. So I was jot this kind of stuff down. And basically, I would shoot it talking head style here. Like this is my main set right now.

And I would just upload it, send it to Caleb. This is a pretty tough and lonely job to be quite honest. Like it's really great. And I love this job. It's lonely. It's lonely being an entrepreneur. It's lonely being anything of success, I think. And so I got to the point and Caleb got to the point where we're just like, dude, what if we just flew you out every single month and we just shot content? And he was like, dude, I would love that. And so basically Caleb flies out once a month now and we shoot like five to seven videos in a two or three day period.

We hang out and we like, you know, burn through the content. And he goes back home and he edits it and we're always like ahead of schedule. Now, he actually didn't do that last month and because we were both really busy. And it is hell, man. It is hell to just record a video by myself. Like I said, it's my job. But it's just not fun. Yeah, as easy as it is. It's really hard to I actually think podcasting is like the best of all media because it's not lonely. Like you're talking to people and you're like checking in and you're like talking, you know, you're having a good time on the hustle.

Or sorry, on my first million. We are on my first million. Yeah, we got to wrap up soon. And I know I see Isaac, it looks like whoever's office it is, they're trying to get in. Is there any last question, Isaac? You want to ask Rob about YouTube? Ben is messaging me. He's saying this YouTube stuff is all gold. All right, I'll come back. Have me on for a part two. That sounds good. How good how many downloads do you get an episode on YouTube? No, on your podcast. Oh, I don't know the exact. I don't know if I'm I don't know.

Ask me off here. I'll tell you over a beer. It's a lot. It's a lot. I think I think so. I have a feeling I'm going to guess and say you're above us, but we do like three to four a week. I think we are in I don't remember we're in the some range between 70 and 100,000 downloads an episode. And which is like, I think pretty good. But man, I want so I think we're at two around the two million a month. I want the YouTube audience. So man, I'm after YouTube is so much easier to grow podcast are the hardest things to grow.

Yeah, I think you got to kind of do it. Well, I mean, if I were doing it now, I would start my podcast on YouTube and try to make a lot of totally and in reels and tick tocks out of that. That's going to be the fastest way you could do it. I mean, not like not that you need to help, but I want to start. I wanted to start a podcast. Then the bigger pockets thing came about and you know, I still have the appetite to start a podcast. But to be honest, like I talk about Airbnb a lot.

And I feel like that's what people expect for me is like an Airbnb podcast. I don't necessarily want to do that. You want to do like like a comedy, like just a fun, like funny thing, which is like very outside of the niche. But you know, you got to be creatively fulfilled. I've got one question for Rob. Go ahead. You already you already sort of answered this when you said that doing the consulting sort of triggered a lot of the questions and general framework for host camp or glam camp, whatever it was back then. But that seems to be to me the number one hurdle, like as far as where to go from here.

I feel like I have like I want to be a messenger. I love to teach people. I don't feel like I know that much, but I'm sure I know something just, you know, with my experience. I need somebody to help me craft the message and basically build the structure and help me build the structure and the topics and all of that the framework for the course. Any suggestions on people I could work with who have experience in that or anything. I think that was valuable. What you said about the consulting is just a first thing first step.

But anything else you want to build on that? Yeah, look, dude, you could make six to seven figures on a course, even without an influence, even without a platform. It's a lot harder and you're going to spend a lot of money on ad, but you could do it. There are a ton of people I see ads for. They got like 5000 followers on Instagram, but they make millions of dollars from the courses. So it's very possible. It's going to be so much easier if you do have a platform, though, if you do have somewhere where you can teach people.

And so like if you can work on your TikTok, your Instagram, your YouTube, I mean, you don't have to be a giant YouTuber to make great money from a course. But I think as far as how to plan out the course and who to work with, I mean, first of all, take your consultations and really digest what they're asking you. Like you're going to get the same set of questions. But once you find what you want your course to be, let's say how to build a seven unit, you know, tiny house village, all you literally have to do is put together a 100 step plan on how you did it.

Episode one or like video one, like choosing your market video to, you know, the difficulties of raw land. Number three, civil engineering, right? And if you can really just like outline that for yourself, I think you'll find that the course actually comes together. It's like, imagine you're doing a one hour presentation on how to build a seven unit, you know, lake retreat. If you're going to put a one hour presentation, start to finish on how to do it. Very quickly, you're going to say, Oh, man, well, what about this? Oh, but I only have an hour.

I got to do this. I got to do this. I got to do this. So I think it really comes through, like in just putting it on paper, because very quickly, you're going to start moving it in and out and stuff like that. Now, if you're looking for actual tangible advice on how to launch the course, check out. There's a guy on YouTube named Graham Cochran. He does like a lot of content around Kajabi, which is a the platform that I use for my course, but he talks about funnels and all that kind of stuff.

I mean, there's so many resources on YouTube. But at the end of the day, I mean, I think you just got to consult for a while as little as possible. And then and then outline it. I think the course will come together. But if you want the most success with your course, I would really focus seeing I would really focus on developing some platform and really building out your email list. That's where most of your money is going to come from, especially if you're doing like a one week launch. Honestly, you could with like the way your machine works right now, if you just built a 10, 20, 30,000 person email list, guarantee you could have a six figure launch like just through that alone.

So email list. No, no, no, no, no, dude. On on 30,000 emails, he would make seven figures for sure. I've made, you know, the hustle was doing, you know, eight figures a year in revenue. And we had courses as well as advertising. And we had a paid subscription business that was making many millions of dollars a year. Making doing 100 K a month in core sales for Isaac would be quite not easy, but very straightforward. It's very straightforward. It would be it. Yeah, I think it would be a lot of work, but it's very straightforward.

Yeah. Well, it's only straightforward after you do it. Like, like if you have a big launch, like then it's like, okay, now I know how to do it. But the first time you're like, what am I doing? I've got a course consultancy that I'm like, yeah, but you have to working on right now. But to for this very thing, you have to keep making content is what I mean. You got to keep creating the once you have the engine, then you just got to continually create content to feed for the top of funnel. It's all to me, I look at it all like a math problem where it's like, all right, so now I know that 3% of my audience buys.

Therefore, I've got to go get way more audience and that 3% will stay constant and I will make X money because my audience is now instead of 30,000, it's 300,000 things like that. Yeah. My first launch that I ever did was a 3000 person email list and it was a $550,000 launch in a week. So yeah, 10,000 people, 20,000, 30,000, it can add up and the best way to build up that list, honestly, start a YouTube channel, create lead magnets, like the top 10 steps to build a tiny house village, make a bunch of videos about that say, Hey, by the way, I have this PDF right here, download it for free.

People will give you their email and you can, you know, basically like market to them that way. Just hit me up. I'll talk to you about it. I got a, we're working on a bigger product like this for people in your in your position. I think I got some tips for you. That's awesome. Thanks a ton. We got to wrap up. Ben, Hey, Ben, what did you think, man? This was kind of interesting. Normally Sean's here, but I'm the Airbnb nerd. I think both these guys are very entertaining and really easy to listen to. What do you think? I loved it.

I loved that Rob and Isaac are like polar opposites in terms of style. And even just the way you guys look. But like, it was great, you know, Isaac, the soft spoken baby face, Rob, the more like brash bearded out there in your face. I'm going to tell you how it is. And it's yin and yang. It worked. Super fun guys. Yeah, you guys are awesome. I, Rob, you already have a following. You're so it's, I always called it row built, but it's Rob built. You can look it up on, on YouTube. I call, I like saying row built.

It's Rob built. It's on YouTube. I think you have the same handle on, you have row built channel on Twitter and then then you have Rob built on Instagram. Oh, it's all the same. So just the word Rob and the word built, but it's one word. And then Isaac French, you, Isaac, you have an awesome name. Isaac French. That's an easy name. You're on Twitter. Is it at Isaac French? It's at Isaac French underscore on Twitter and Instagram just launched on both couple of weeks ago. And then the name of your property is live oak Lake.

Yep. Live oak Lake.com and on Instagram. Yeah. It's on the Instagram. It's at stay at live oak Lake. Sick guys. This is awesome. We'll do it again. This is really fun. Sam, thanks a ton for inviting us. I think this is going to be a hit. Thanks for coming. Super fun, man. Yeah. Let me know when you, when you want that part too. I'm in or let me know next time a guest drops out last second and I'm on so long as I put this possible. So long as I'm free. All right, dude, I got you.

I think we get along well. All right. That's a pod.
