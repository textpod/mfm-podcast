Eco friendly ones that kept track of things smart water bottles. I've just never done it. Yeah, dude I'm fine. I'm they called me hose water was my middle name in high school I Do you want to do a recap on Rob Deirdeck because I've been getting blown up about about that blown up Yeah, this is I would say definitely the most the biggest reaction we've had to an episode in a long time maybe ever ever I'd probably say ever the the the one thing that I got was basically people said this is not just The best podcast you guys have done But this is maybe the best episode I've ever listened to of any podcast and I don't it's definitely wasn't us that made it great But he was pretty amazing, right? He was and I didn't know how it would turn out I remember literally being amazed in the moment like the things he was saying were very surprising to me and very interesting And I wanted to know more and he told he was very open so that was dope as well But I'd you never know like how the episode turns out and there's all these different factors You know from audio quality to like do people care what this person has to say are they interested? We're interested in people definitely dug it.

Yeah, you're right people were saying like That my top three podcast episodes this year was Naval on Tim Ferriss Rob on your guys's pod and then whatever some Reply all podcasts that happened so it was like not just this is yall's best but this is one of the best I've heard and There's people tweeting like alright. This is the fourth person that mentioned this to me I gotta go listen to this today. So something definitely happened. I'm curious in the numbers what that's gonna show In a couple good. They're good. I've looked at him he okay, so Rob Deardek on the podcast mentioned his schedule and I was curious about it.

And so I actually asked him to email me What that looked like and he sent me a screenshot. I sent it to you Sean Can you read what it what it's what it is and? Basically like at first glance, what does it look like when you see his schedule? It's a picture of his Gmail or his calendar So it looks like well, there's a few there's a few views But the one I'm looking at it looks like I would say a combination between like a P&L like you know a businesses P&L cash flow statement and or like you know just like a research doc put out by Gartner about you know the trends of an industry.

This doesn't look like one person's you know weekly schedule And if you look at the view of his calendar every single minute of his day is marked off every minute Yeah, it's blocked off now some of it is like you know it could be like whatever free time or something like that like family and kids Right, so it's not saying he's working all the time but every minute is is accounted for every minute has a purpose and It says here I track every hour of every day throughout the day and tag each entry I have a script written that pulls and pulls the time and populates into these two spreadsheets One is daily time use and the other is monthly average So should we do the much we look at his monthly average real quick.

Yeah, all right, so monthly average will take We'll take September. Okay, so September. He's got sleep which was 6.9 hours health 1.2 hours Life which is like kind of like family and things like that 7.8 hours and then work 8.1 hours per day It's pretty consistent like work never in any month in the whole year the lowest month is February 5.8 hours and the highest month was October 9.3 hours, right? Sleep almost always 6.8 or 6.9 hours per day. So this is a pretty meticulous Meticulous thing and by the way in the work category. He's got like TV shows, right? Here's my TV shows Here's what here's how many hours I'm spending on TV shows not watching TV making TV Yeah, making TV making his TV shows And then there's like the doodic machine which is kind of like his business that builds businesses And then there's other which is you know random meetings and stuff like that Very cool.

Very cool in health. He's got gym meditation personal care other For life. He's got you know him and his wife kids Friends and social and then other right so this is this is sick. Do you think okay? So let's let's let's talk about this just for two seconds Do you think that this does this work for you because by the way? I'm saying this out loud, but I'm gonna package this if he's okay with it I'm gonna package us and post it somewhere. It's a visual thing So we should basically like you know on Twitter and newslet I'll put on my newsletter too, but like we should post this so people can see it if he's cool with it I'll ask him.

Yeah, and do you think that do you roll this way because You and I joke like the best days are when there's nothing on the calendar and when people cancel stuff And and that feels like the best day to me Although sometimes I feel lazy and sometimes I feel meaningless, but do you do you like to operate this way? Or do you like to operate with the open calendar or what? So I'll tell you some of my I'll tell you two things I'll tell you my calendar philosophy do I want to be scheduled or unscheduled.

I want to be the opposite of this I want to be completely unscheduled And you know, I don't know why that is the case. It used to be the opposite So my calendar used to look a lot like his I used to block out like I used to just do it at high level like work block 1 lunch work block 2 gym, you know family time Yeah, end of night kind of like hobby reading random random bullshit or whatever I used to just kind of like schedule out my day like that and try to keep it And then I would have like in the in a week I would have one day like I still have this and one day where I do 90 minutes of random meetings meaning People that are just fine interesting.

I just want to meet with no agenda and just kind of like cool people meet meeting cool people And so I do schedule time full randomness, but for the most part I've gone away from having a highly scheduled day to having an unscheduled day Meaning I don't schedule it in advance on the day of I decide what I'm gonna do and I decide how I'm gonna spend today But I don't decide that like two weeks in advance. And so when somebody says can we meet I have a simple rule It's like do I want to meet you right if you want to do a call you want to meet me Do I want to meet you right now? If so, I'm gonna say would you like to do it right now? If not, I'll say I can't do right now, but I'll give you a call in an hour or two hours from now And if I don't want to do it right now I say sorry I don't want to meet and I don't schedule it for like three weeks from now, which is what I used to do I used to say I don't want to do this.

Okay. Yeah, I'm free two weeks But then guess what two weeks shows up and then I'm like shit. I gotta do this call. I didn't want to do then I definitely don't want to do it now. It's expired. Yeah, it keeps me up the night before sometimes Yeah, so I'm I'm much more of an unscheduled person But the day of I decide how I'm gonna use today's time Yeah, it uh his his calendar was amazing to me And I think that it's gonna be quite popular when you post that maybe a maybe we'll have to divvy up who could post what because we could I both did the gold.

Yeah All right, let's only ask you Did you ever do this time tracking shit because I also went through like an aggressive time tracking phase and I wanted to share one learning from that I wouldn't I was never aggressive about it. No, I I I prefer open time and I prefer working from midnight until like 3 a.m When and that's when I do a lot of my golden stuff So like if I have to copyright what I if I have to do any type of copywriting I I'll hang out all day and read and have fun and Sarah's like when are you gonna do work I'm like when you go to bed and so she'll go to bed and then from midnight to three sometimes midnight to four I can get I can do golden golden work around that around that hour I have a theory about this.

So furkan who was my technical co founder of a previous company He's been on the pod. He was the same way He would I would like he would roll into work at 11 11 30 He'd start his work day with lunch and like you would think this is the laziest guy ever But actually he was he's massively hard working He was just up till five in the morning on average Yeah, and so, you know five in the morning that he sleeps, you know six hours he wakes up at 11 and he comes into work and And even when he was at work like we would take like an hour.

We just play video games. We were just like and I was just like, dude Why do you use your time this way? He goes? He goes, I don't know. I just oh I just figured this out for myself early on which is that like the time I act like during the day It's just like I'm basically just trying to exhaust myself like I want to have conversations I kind of manage other people. I kind of read shit. I'll talk to people. I'll eat lunch. I'll go work out I'll do all this stuff. He's like, I'm basically just trying to get myself really like like I need to my brain to slow down And I want to get in this almost like half sleepy state Which is not sleepy the way most people think about it most people think sleepy means you can't function But there is a point where you're like kind of tired, you know, you get kind of loopy Yeah, and it's like that's when you could do creative work and programming is creative work So he's like dude from like midnight to 4 a.m.

I write the best code and it's basically like only my hands are moving I don't want to get up. Nobody bothers me. Nobody talks to me. I don't have to meet anybody I just and I just go into flow state and I just work during that time and that's kind of what you're describing Is your midnight to 3 a.m. I have that same thing and I figured out through Furkan on that There's this thing that happens where if you're trying to do creative work You need to be more relaxed and less kind of like distracted and also like a little loopy is good Because it adds a little bit of like serendipity into your brain Your brain's willing to play with different ideas and go in different directions Maybe it's over copywriting.

You kind of want something like that. Also, I believe 23 and me has a like a line item on one of their attributes And it talks about are you at night out or an early or an early person? And I so I think that a lot of this stuff of when you're gonna get your creative work done I actually think it's genetic and whatever it is you should just go all in on it for example I mean the world set up for early risers, you know If you if you get up at 5 a.m. It gets up done like Rob did or like you win you win Like it's the world set up So actually if you're a night person like I am or you and you kind of got to go against the grain which sucks But here's a good example the founder of box the CEO of box.

What's his name Ben Levy? Sorry, Ben Levy is my guy. Yeah, Aaron Levy Aaron Levy up close to a billionaire Maybe hundreds of millions of millionaire founder of a multi billion dollar company I was friends with his assistant and she would tell me that he has no meetings until 11 a.m And that's typically when he starts at the office because he works until 5 a.m. And By the way, Bezos is the opposite Bezos is like I want all my meetings from 8 a.m. To noon all all important decisions I need to make by then because my brain is functioning the best and then after that I don't want to have any important meetings in the day I'll have other meetings but no disno key decisions no heavy topics with important like stuff to digest I want to do other work during that time and so and like, you know, Rob Durdek on his calendar here It's 4 30 a.m.

Wake up wake up call pretty much every single day one one day. He sleeps until 5 a.m You know, so he's a little bit different cat I think it's you know what works for you and and then you want to play to that like I spent many years trying to be like I want to wake up at 5 a.m. So I could be more productive and it's just like Waking up three hours earlier was way harder for me than just staying up three hours later And so it's like why am I fighting what's easy for me? What feels like play to me versus what feels like an absolute grind to me and it's sort of unsustainable It's all willpower based and so, you know, I made that shift, but I'll give you one thing.

That's that is worth doing So I tried to like track every hour to see how I'm using it because I kind of want it You know time is your most precious asset. So I wanted to see how it gets spent That was a little bit exhausting. Hopefully someday there's gonna be tools that just make this easy So it's like it just happens passively But one thing that is amazing is a calendar audit. I don't know if you've ever done one of these It's a calendar audit or some people call it an energy audit It basically means you take for one week you sort of keep track of like roughly how you used each hour and And then what you do is the next week you just go back you just pull up last week's calendar You take three colored markers you take a green marker a red marker and a yellow marker and You go back through your week how you spent your time You say what which block which thing I did gave me energy.

I marked those green Which felt like it sucked all the energy out of me I was drained afterwards and I felt like my soul lived and sucked out of me I'll let me mark those red and then the neutral things. Let me mark yellow and you look at the painting You know, you look at your color and you're like, wow, that's a lot of red or hey, that's actually pretty good That's a lot of green and then you just audit And so you're all you're doing is just trimming the fat and you just say all right cool this week I'm gonna do less of the red stuff.

I'm gonna do less by just literally avoiding it by automating it or delegating it And you just make a decision you just improve it by one week And you just do that every so often and if you do that It's an amazing way to manage not your calendar as in like maximizing efficiency But maximizing your energy so that you feel good and you are when you feel your best You're gonna, you know perform your best I think Bayzo said the stuff that you should eliminate is you you you can answer that by asking will this Work just fine if I don't make this decision or if I don't if I don't attend this or do this will life be okay if yes and eliminate it Right.

Do you want to talk about some ideas? Yeah, let's do some other stuff Which where do you want to go? Well, I've got a lot Yeah, we both got a lot so we have a couple episodes worth of stuff here Give me one off yours that you're really into okay. Have you heard of brewmate? No, and I'm not a coffee drinker. Is it a coffee drinking thing? It doesn't have to be so okay So brewmate it spelled the BRU M A T E their first thing was like a coosie basically their first product was a was a coosie Something that interested me about this and now they make tumblers.

So basically what's a tumbler like a just a coffee drink Thermos yeah, a thermos thing they make a coosie. They make a water bottle they just make cups for cold stuff and hot stuff and The reason why this interested me is trends my company trends trends.co We did a story on brewmate and they interviewed the founder and they did a good job And I think Julia wrote it and they got a picture of the revenue. So check this out Jacob who's the founder Jacob grew brewmate to 20 million in revenue without a single employee and And so this company launched in 2016 their revenue was basically 2016 nothing 2017 it looks single digit hundreds of thousands maybe close to a million 2018 getting close to 20 million in revenue 2019 over 25 million in revenue 2020 a hundred million in revenue and he did most everything with agencies and contractors and a Single full time employee until after 20 million in revenue and it got me thinking one.

That's amazing That's like the greatest thing ever if you ask me I think that's like the the ideal business in number two these water bottle and cup businesses This is something that like if you told me you're gonna start that I'm gonna do that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of What are you doing? I there are so many example examples of some of these things that are huge for example There's a business called swell. You know swell water bottles No, I by the way, I'm since college. I've been the type of person that just never uses water bottles me neither I'm like I buy that I would I go to water fountains And I just like put my mouth on the fucking thing and I drink from a water fountain That's what I do and everybody else has like amazing elaborate water bottles always Eco friendly ones that kept track of things smart water bottles.

I've just never done it. Yeah, dude I'm fine. I'm they called me hose water was my middle name in high school I'm Like I Don't I wish I had made that up as a dig on you called you water, but that's so perfect So I thought I was going low bar like my low class thing was a water fountain Yeah, like if there was like a new coke product that was hose water flavor like from Missouri I'd be drinking that shit because that's what I grew up on so I'm not like Can we share this we? So the interview we did with Brian Halligan the CEO of HubSpot They're playing it at inbound, which is the huge marketing conference I think that's the ad for these podcast or something is inbound go to about great.

So They're playing the the recording there as an interview and so for weeks For weeks our guy has been you'll produce the pod The producer of the pod was badgering us like hey guys They need this intake form and like you know, I'm just like allergic to words like that So, you know, what's that Jeff bezels thing? Can what happens if I don't do this? That was my my dick and it was yours, too It was like hey guys, I need you to fill this out I need you to sign this waiver saying you're okay with the content being on there I'm okay with it like obviously it's a public free podcast.

You can just use it wherever you want And they're like no no no you got to sign this thing I'm like oh my god I got a download a PDF and figure out a sign this so weeks go by me and Sam both do nothing at one point He goes hey Sam that intake form, you know, they're really asking me for it Sam goes oh you can tell And he's just joking but we basically we didn't do it right and so another week goes by you guys All right guys, I really need this intake form.

So we were like fine. I'll sign the thing He's like oh, I also need a bio for you And it's like what's your what's your job title? What's your bio? I don't know dude I host a podcast and I like build random businesses that like it's not I don't have a good job title And I don't have like a bio for you. And so I just wrote future owner of the LA Lakers and then Future owner of a lake It's true man, it's true. I think that's different between us Embodied the difference between us so perfectly It was amazing.

All right that back to that you can cut you can cut that part out if you're gonna get fired for that thing No, you could keep that We don't do anything so Stupid it's not stupid. Yeah, and so there's this thing called swell look up swell look up swell It's a water bottle. I'm not a water bottle guy there. It looks like the dumbest thing ever I mean, it's not dumb It just looks like the most normal thing ever then there's corksicle which is basically a cork water bottle over 80 million Revenue and then there's one called BKR.

I actually don't know how to say that beaker, but but I don't know They then they sell water bottle for a hundred and eighty five dollars It's glad and this was actually cool because I hate metal water bottles and I hate plastic It's glass, but it has like plastic or like rubber around it. So you don't shatter it anyway Who would have thought Who would have thought yeah crazy and did he say how he scaled because this is one of the most aggressive Aggressive scaling business I've ever heard of so to go from basically Sub one million to 18 million in one year and then to go from like I don't know looks like maybe 30 million To a hundred million.

You know, these are huge jumps Facebook ads and so basically he said that so he didn't spend a dime So or sorry, he didn't build anything So he created a landing page and then he drove Facebook ads to it And he got a prelaunch email list of six thousand people and then he sent those folks an email to buy it and they bought it And he used that money to go and build the product It's classic. Wow. Yeah a classic way so kind of interesting And so that's that an idea, but I just wanted to bring that up Now that's cool.

I like that one Yeah, do we have anything to rip off that or just like you know props of this guy? No props of that guy, but That's it and it looks like he used a bunch of like Like working capital is always very hard for ecommerce businesses And so it looks like you know, he couldn't get a line of credit early So he did pre sales and then okay did pre sales Danny through the pre sales now. He got an expensive line of credit So You know, he got he got an SBA loan He got Shopify capital PayPal working capital Amazon landing He would use one to pay the next and that just like let him roll over one from one line of credit to the next dude In a way and after doing an audit He got a two million dollar line of credit and now raise $20 million in a way I think that these people are so audacious and here's why if you told me if this guy I don't know what his name is if you told me that you're gonna launch a water bottle I'm like Jacob.

You're an idiot. This is the stupidest thing ever and you know who else I would have said that to Movement watches so this guy also named Jacob. Jake Cassan spoke at hustle con. This was like pre D to C even being a word Okay, so Jacob Cassan he launched his company called movement or Cassin. Sorry launched this company called movement They were shitty watches from China They ordered a bunch and they start selling them on movement comm or whatever then they kind of make them a little bit better But they're still like not the most high quality watches and his company He sold that thing for two hundred million dollars and again if you would have showed me this watch and be like you were crazy No one's gonna buy this.

This is just ridiculous and I've talked to him and he's like well Why not like people buy watches? Why won't they buy mine? I think that confidence is awesome and I love it I don't know if I have it, but I love it Yeah, it takes it definitely takes guts and I think you know one thing I've learned is that these spaces So there's like there's there's the niche spaces which we love and then there's also the everybody every day problems And that's what like keeping beverages hot and cold is and I think you want to go on one end of the spectrum or the other You need to go hyper niche where it's like yeah, I'm you know for a specific type of toe fungus This is the this is the best cream and I'm just gonna target that and on the other side you go Everybody every day problems, and I'm just gonna try to sell this thing because my ads will apply to everybody and so there's basically like You know like I've been looking at a different water brands So what's the one in Austin? So there's like LeCroy or whatever is like kind of like a larger topo Chico, baby I just go like it Topo Chico has been around for a while there.

What's the one that's like the startup that Lance Armstrong invested in that's yeah I was in Austin. Let me look it up. I know we water or something like water water loo. Is that it? Yeah, that's it I think it's water loo. Okay, so there's water loo. They got huge. They're like, oh, yeah, we're at 50 million in sales There's a brand called ugly water founder sent me a case of that. Thank you for that ugly water again Cool sparkling water crushing it doing millions and millions of dollars in sales And I'm like dude. How many more of these can there liquid death? We had liquid death on probably a hundred million in sales Yeah, exactly.

So, you know, you know just bottled water again, like, you know canned water sparkling water Like my trainer was talking to me yesterday and he's like bro. Let's start a coconut water brand I was like, yeah, we should because you know what like Coconut water is a massive market and like you could just go in and do more he's from Hawaii So he's like bro, like I grew up on this stuff. We can we can brand it right we can get it out there And I was like, okay, cool Let me find an operator So if somebody wants to start a coconut water brand with me just email me Sean at Sean puri.com

because I want to start one And by start what I mean, I want you to do most the work and I'll do Virtually nothing. So let's let's do that split. Can you can you talk about this guy con the NFL owner? Yes, by the way, can I do two quick updates? Yeah one There's a guy, you know, you talked about like just buying a giant ranch buying giant farmland or whatever There's a guy who hit me up. He's very credible. Who's like, I'll do this for you guys like I will go find it I'll find the right thing.

I'll acquire. I'll get the permits. I'll build it out and like, you know, let's just partner on it and so I Love this podcast because it basically matches dude. Well, you get all like why is it the ugly water guy is setting? Why is it ugly water guy setting me water? Why is it ranch guy setting? That's what I was into Yeah, you're into it. I think my emails easier to find. I don't know and people people just guess my email easier Like I off dude my email is the same as yours Sam at Sam part calm.

It's literally the exact same thing This let me tell you this. So a youtuber reached out. So shout out to Rebecca. Who's a youtuber who reached out? She's got 10 million YouTube subscribers amazing. She's a big star channels awesome and She's a fan of the pod and she had email and reached out said hey I listen to the pod or her I think her husband reached out or brother or business manager somebody reached out said hey It's her birthday tomorrow. She'd love to like meet you guys as like a birthday present. No, she didn't say you guys Okay, she said whatever she said but she put both of our email.

They had both of our emails on there But for you what they had like holler at the hustle.com which I don't know if that's a real email or not I went back and looked and it's holler. Maybe it's even spelled wrong. I don't know is holler your email address No, that's not my email address. Maybe that's why I didn't get it Fuck I don't know. I don't know what that is. I Can tell by the word holler at the husband. I guarantee you made that up one day Yeah, years ago that that was supposed to be our our help email Yeah, exactly.

I guarantee that like just holler at me like we'll fix it just holler at me All right, anyways, what was gonna tell you the other one the other update is This guy sent me a screenshot. He's like ten thousand dollars. He goes. Thank you for that idea I don't remember we had done an idea either here on Twitter about Moving bins. This is very simple idea Which is like when you move you need these like packing bins just like these plastic heavy duty bins So you don't have to do boxes. She's pack all your stuff you move to your other place You unpack you unpack it.

You just return the bins You just rent these bins for the day while you move and I had like done done the numbers I was like this thing is kind of great. It's like, okay, maybe you can't buy a property and rent it out But you can buy 50 of these bins and rent them out and you can make good money And so he emailed he's like hey, it's been a long sweat like I'm not saying it was easy but you know about ten thousand dollars made from these bins and You know, thanks for the idea.

I just really appreciate that. That's you know It's kind of been a great side income for me in my city and I'm like, oh, this is cool Like that's that's the best feeling of this whole podcast It's basically if we throw the ideas out there and then people actually run with them and make something happen out of it So let me tell you something about that. First of all, that's amazing So have you ever been to the grocery store and seen one of those carpet cleaners? carpet cleaners like Like a vacuum or something. Yeah, so it looks like a vacuum, but it's it's meant for It looks like a vacuum.

No, it's like you push it. You've never seen one of these So like people like there's a heavy duty carpet cleaning like like more like a deep clean Yes, and people rent those for like two hundred dollars a day. You know I'm talking about Yeah, I know like it's kind of like the equivalent of power washing or something like that before your carpet Yes, okay So I was thinking I was like looking at this and they a lot of them have a meter on there and they and that's like the hours The hours that it can go for long have been long So like they it's like a dirt biker like a boat where it's like instead of saying how many miles does it have on it's how Many hours and so a lot of these things a lot of these carpet cleaners they can last for something like Five years, so let's I don't know if this is a big number.

Yeah, long time Yeah, so I don't know if this is exactly how it would work, but let's say three and sixty five or fit There's 52 weeks at a year 52 times 40 let's see. I'm just doing it really quick to 60. Okay in public math. Are you know I'm doing it on my computer Okay, so we don't do public math so a lot of these things will last like 10 to 15 thousand hours and They rent out for like $200 a day which comes out to be like, you know, $20 an hour I think buying in renting carpet cleaners is one of the greatest like banks for your money when I went I went to the grocery store and I just looked at how much does this cost and I looked at how much they cost to buy They cost like $800 to buy So this thing at the grocery store that I keep seeing all I would see it all the time and then I once I saw those I would say to the people I'm like how often do those rent for? Do the people rent them a lot and they're like, yeah all the time.

They're always being rented out It's like one of the greatest things I've ever seen when I was like doing the math I'm like, this is brilliant the carpet goes back to our teenage side hustle Like if you're a teenager you have a teenager just get one of these and then teach your teenager how to bake like kind of like one page sales letters and Yelp ads and basically just drop the sales letters in you know under everyone's door Every month so you got a print out a hundred of these put them in your neighborhood and just say hey Hey, yall I live over here at 37 terrace woodway and I bought this cleaner.

It's amazing Here's the before and after of my carpet, but you know, I'm not gonna use this You know, I only needed to use it once and it made such a big difference But I still got the thing if you want it. I'll rent it out to you for 40 bucks. Just text me here I'll bring it to your house if you want your carpet clean and if you want me to do it for you I'll do it for 150 and And and you know just do that and like that's such a good teenage side hustle Because you know, you'll learn sales you learn marketing you learn a little bit of like unit economics It's just a little way to get kind of make your first dollar I think making your first dollars massively underrated like I didn't make my first doll my first hustle dollar where like Not like a job where I was sitting at a cash register all day But like me creating a product and selling it to somebody I didn't do that till I was like 19 I'm sure you did earlier because I think you were flipping stuff on eBay or something I think you were more of a hustler early on than well Yeah, but eBay eBay doesn't feel like the first dollar though Maybe it does.

It's kind of like you had the scheme. It's not a job basically like yeah Kind of like first dollar out of business. Yeah But by the way, it's very young dude Actually, maybe I thought you were gonna say like 30 There's 21 or 22 is right when that right after I graduated and so it's probably 22 actually and so like, you know I wish that that 22 was 12 I think that it's like learning languages or you know like working out like the earlier you learn these core skills the better and So, you know, if you if you're sitting there and you even if you're 29 right now 39 Whatever it is and you're at a job.

You've just never done this I really encourage you to go make your first dollar as a side hustle as a business make a product or find a product and sell it and You know, it's it's surprising how it'll kind of like change the way you look at things Yeah, I agree. That's what I told Sarah when she was doing her course I'm like if you just get make one dollar and it's gonna change your life Can you tell me about this con guy? I love this guy. Yeah. All right. This is the Billy of the week and by the way By the way, we should have been pop on Ben Ben come on here real quick We got a new producer and one of the things I'm gonna ask them to do is for our little segments make sure we do our segments like Billy the week people love that segment we should do it and to We got to have like a little sound a little jingle a little something whenever we go to this segment I think and Ben Ben's the host of the how to take for the world podcast If you're not subscribed to that do it He did this those Edison episodes that we released about Thomas Edison.

He has almost a show now He has almost a hundred thousand listens a month Whoo, all right, Ben. Okay big dog. I'm surprised you're even still here with that big number not Not for long Sean if you keep pumping me up like this then you're not your head's not even gonna fit in the We'll get the window We'll try out a sound we'll play something on this episode a little like Billy of the week jingle and see how people feel about it All right, sounds good You got to replace a braille you at the end when we used to ask about you how we did and he gave us the straight talk That's good.

$10,000,000 isn't cool. You know, it's cool a billion dollars Anyways back to the Billy of the week so this guy his name is Shahid Khan He's from Pakistan and he his story is kind of insane. So here's the guy who? moved to America at age 16 first job is a dishwasher for I think a dollar sixty an hour and You know, so he starts making a dollar sixty an hour and today he's worth nine billion dollars personally and How the heck did he do that? So do you know this guy's story a little bit? I know him because he's incredibly recognizable.

He's like he's kind of beautiful like if he looks He looks like a badass a little bit. He looks like a bad ass Pretty cock. Well, he looks like someone who's I built respect and fear because they seem formidable and also they look like they like to party Yeah, he's got a fucking sick mustache basically that's his like icon of things got one of the mustaches That's like so almost a twirl at the end. It's amazing. So he looks really special is the way I would describe him in a good way Okay, so what is his story? So he he starts off dishwasher.

He's like sleeping at the YMCA And like, you know now that he's super rich He like donates millions of dollars to the YMCA because he's like dude. I used to sleep in here I used to hide in the YMCA and sleep because it was so cold outside And I didn't I couldn't afford like, you know where I was supposed to live and so he So he got rich by he made his millions by billions really by building custom bumpers for cars So car bumpers truck bumpers car bumpers that sort of thing. So here's like how it all worked So he he graduates as an engineering student and he gets a job at this company that does manufacturing for For bumper for car bumpers and he kind of like works his way up first few years I think he's there for maybe five seven years something like that He's eventually he's like kind of like leading the engineering operations and he's sort of like man This is so inefficient the way we do this we get all these different parts It would try to like jam them together to make this car bumper and it's real heavy.

It's really clunky. It's kind of ugly and And I think the company was called flexing gate or later It was called flexing gate, but he's working at this company and then he along the way He's sort of like he's trying to convince the company like hey We should change the design, but they're not really listening to him. So he's like, all right screw it I'm gonna spin out my own company and I'm gonna design my own bumpers And so he quits he takes I think he has sixteen thousand dollars in personal savings. He takes like a fifty thousand dollar Sba loan and he goes and he creates his own Bumper company right and so he he starts trying to go get clients They're trying to go get customers and he's getting you know some small customers and along the way as he's making progress He gets sued by his previous employer.

They're like hey you stole trade secrets and Your competitor your competition now. So like screw you we're gonna we're gonna sue you and he's like shit like They're way bigger than me. I can't afford, you know, I can't afford a lawyer basically So I'm like how am I gonna fight this in court and I know their strategy their strategy is gonna be like they just They just bleed me out, right? Like they're bigger to me This is gonna cost both of us money, but they're they have deeper pockets So he comes up with a strategy where he hires the cheapest lawyer he could find Just to sort of like stall the case and then like so it's costing him almost nothing to continue It's costing them a lot of money They're losing a lot of money on this lawsuit and then he starts studying every night like after the business operations are done He goes to the library and he starts studying law so that he can defend himself in court Because he hires this kind of like Saul Goodman, you know type of character and just you know wants to defend himself so he starts educating himself and So he ends up winning the case and along the way that company flexing gate was losing like $50,000 a month And so they were their business wasn't very healthy.

So by the end he wins the case And he just ends up it takes the money and he has the money from his business and he buys out flexing gate So he buys out the company I was suing him as like a kind of like a fuck you plus a consolidation of like how much he paid for it Do you know I don't know the exact number that he ended up buying him for but you know Sort of like baller move going back there and he had designed this bumper that was like a slick kind of like One continuous piece so it wasn't a bunch of pieces put together and it was way more lightweight And so all of a sudden the car companies were like, oh, this is great.

We want to have a lighter weight thing. It's better for fuel efficiency It's easier for manufacturing. It's cheaper Fantastic, so they start going to him and so he starts getting like these contracts And there's like all these little sub stories in here that like I don't want to dive too far into but like he wants to get the like Suzuki Contract and so he like hires a bunch of people who know to speak Japanese He starts learning all about the culture. He like goes there because he's like I have to go further than anyone else Is gonna go to win this deal because I'm a no name brand But I have a great product and if I can make these guys trust me and believe in me this will work So he lands a zoo key shortly after that he gets the big Toyota contract now like as of today I think he's basically making like every automakers bumpers like I think you know There's like 20 million plus cars that are have his bumper something ridiculous some ridiculous number like 30% of all cars He uses bumpers and so you know the company Does billions and billions of dollars his personal net worth is ballooned to where he He owns nine billion dollars or he's worth nine billion dollars I believe as his personal net worth and he's done a bunch of other things So he bought the Jacksonville Jaguar so he wanted to own an NFL team and he tries to buy the Denver Broncos But at the last minute the guy who was the minority owner had a right of first refusal and like Exercise it and bought the Broncos out from under him stand cranky and so he's like ah shit, but he became friends with the guys who Are the people who own the jet in the Jaguars he buys the Jaguars and he starts doing some pretty interesting things So the Jaguars are kind of like one of the bottom of the barrel team.

Yeah, and there's still not great, right? They're not great They've never they've had like very small windows of time where the team was good But it's never like a high profile franchise really it's like one of the small markets And so he's like okay, how do I play the game to like how do I use this to my advantage? So he's like alright ticket sales are low and he starts to dig into why it's like Ah, it's just so expensive to come to a game the average fan is priced out So he does something like pretty radical like he he He made it where any fan can bring their own food to the games Which is like the opposite of what every other stadium tries to do where they're like, you know low ticket But then we'll charge you like $30 for a hot dog Yeah, he was I bring your own food and what ends up happening is ticket sales go up And I think food revenue went up when they got to the stadium like you know something counterintuitive result like that and You know, he started doing a bunch of other things like he He put a fantasy football tracker in the stadium on the scoreboard.

He's like oh fans You know, they're not just here to watch the game They're here for entertainment and part of their entertainment is their fantasy team So he like would show your points while you're while you're there and people got a kick out of that And he like pimped out the locker room for the players. He's like I want to have like the best locker room Very similar things to what Mark Cuban did with the with the Dallas Mabs by the way So similar sort of playbook. He now owns a we which is like a head to head competitor with WWE like Vince McMahon's thing So it's like a wrestling wrestling thing.

He's got this crazy yacht called Kiss Smith, which is like a I don't know it's like a I Don't know how much this yacht cost but to rent it cost 1.2 million per week And that excludes food fuel and docket costs and so like, you know, Beyonce and Jay Z Rented this thing out for their Italy vacation. I think it's like a 200 million dollar yacht that he rents out for a million dollars a week Dude, that's nuts. What are you? What's your biggest takeaway from him? I? Just love this sort of like I mean this rags to riches story is kind of like amazing and I think it's It's inspiring and so I think there's a lot of people who who could do this You're in a company you see things done inefficiently and if you had the guts You would basically be able to spin out and like you know your own competitor inside and out because you were there as a leader And so you know where their weaknesses are you know what the customer needs are and you know if you start to chip away Like you can make a lot more than you would ever make climbing the corporate ladder there And then I love some of the like atypical bets that he was making or moves that he's making like going into wrestling I think it's super interesting.

Most people don't think about that or there's no way that will work by the way There's no way well. I think it's already made made quite a bit because he bought he bought this I think he bought the thing for dirt cheap and there's just like there's always a perpetual number two to WWE So he doesn't need to become WWE right like yes, there is a long shot Bull case where you know he ends up overtaking it But there's always been a number two like WCW back in the day or like you know the local Yeah local shows and whatnot and so I think that there's a lot of money in even being them like a really strong credible number two and I think WWE ends up buying all their competition and so he might end up flipping it to them someday But it takes like some deep pockets.

So it might fail like you know, that's okay Do I think I like these types of bets is inspiring to me like a guy like this. Yeah, I think it's really cool I'm reading the there's an awesome article about him the New York Times. It's an old one It's about from 2011 and basically it says Jaguars buyer has eyes on had his eyes on owner ownership franchise And the dream has come true and he talks about like how it's been his dream to do that and the whole like immigrant You know like this was like the the to me This is an American thing is to own a team and I think that's really great.

So anyway, I think it's cool I love a lot of racism stuff to you by the way I was reading about that like in Jacksonville There's a bunch ticket holders who canceled it because they an American didn't own the team now and he's like dude I could we are Americans but you know, so I think he's Even even even still you know still fighting certain certain battles. Yeah, I did of course And I dig this this is a good one I feel like every Billy of the week that we've ever done is like basically an immigrant.

There's definitely a recurring theme here We got to do an American Billy a born and bred American Billy of the week. No, I like the immigrant stories I prefer those. Let me tell you about a cool app that I found Well, it's a web app. So a website. It's called fuck you pay me and so the you are the URL is F Y P M dot VIP it's kind of confusing But I just sent it to you and it's in the dock actually as well and I just sent it on Riverside and so fuck you pay me.

So basically what it is It's the it's kind of glass door slash yelp for influencers And so if you are an influencer you can log on and you could see which brands are Easy to work with and how much they pay and people want to work with them again, and I think this is interesting For a couple reasons the biggest one is well like this is cool But the second reason why I like this is because these types of businesses I actually think are incredibly easy to set up and if you could start getting reviews And if you could start getting people to use it very valuable So basically this website if I don't know what it's built with but I bet you that there's some just like It's probably a WordPress like a login or something like that like very very very simple stuff You could you could build this in like two or three days and there's another good example of this and that that's called VC guide.co

so we're talking about influencers and venture capitalists because that's in our world But have you ever been a VC guide.co? Yeah, I've been to it. Yeah, okay So it's the most basic looking website you've ever seen it's just a list of names and people Vote on and or leave reviews on different venture capitalists But anyway, I think that this is a really really cool business and I love this idea There's another one that I was looking at called niche niche calm which is not small But they like it's the same type of thing but just they do it for schools and so I think that there's a lot of really cool Businesses that could be built with this model another one that I think could exist and similar to influencers is Like basically all the publishers out there like bustle Who else I don't I mean whatever just all they pay freelancers by the article or by the word And I think that you could if you wanted to you could do a price per article for publishers You could do how much anyone pays for anything basically in terms of freelance work and so anyway I think this is a cool business.

It's called fuck you pay me. I think it's awesome Yeah, I think this is a cool as like a I think it was started by a couple influencers, right? Yeah, but I don't remember their name. Yeah, so I think it's a good Like salt scratching their own itch right like at some point they get tired of Working with clients that don't pay up on time or try to renaik on the deal and they say look if we band together We could do this and they already have a network of other friends who do this they have trust They know the problem.

So I think that's a great Look, uh, niche business business to start and if you're in a world like in an industry The I think these are actually easier to build like for example If you are in the automotive world automotive manufacturing and you have 50 friends who Work in that business you could pretty like easily kind of get this going and it becomes addicting I remember I'm not on VC guy. Thank God. I'm not a VC but I do invest But like let's see are you on it Sean like you start checking your name all the time Yeah, exactly.

You want to know what are people saying about me? Yeah, you check it all the time And so anyway, I think like they're I think these are really interesting and this is kind of a cool one. I Have a super quick idea. I'll just do that's related to this. I saw this company. I should give them a shout out I think it's called pump and what they're doing is actually pretty cool. It's You know like investor so you wrote great investor updates I used to be on your but I wasn't an investor in the hustle, but you used to send me the updates I don't know why I just it's cool.

I could see it And you wrote really great investor updates like it was clear It was like just the right mix of like the info you need not too much and not too little and you had like a clear Ask if you needed something dude, I see a lot. I see a lot of companies using that same template I don't know if I stole that if I took that from someone or like you like Kevin Lee from the ramen company His updates look exactly the same. I don't know what it is, but that that style.

I feel like is everywhere now Yeah, I don't know where you got it from, but it's great I wish more of the founders I invest in would do it because mine don't do that That's out of the there either like ultra detail It's like we hired this engineer and this person and they used to work here. It's like all right I really just okay. I'm glad you did that But like what does that matter to me like it's two in the weeds for where I am at to help your business and then they'll leave out like Here's how many customers we have and here's so much money's in the bank as much here's what we need Here's where our goals are like they'll leave that out, but they'll go into like ultra detail about other stuff So anyways, I think in general investor updates take a lot of time They're really healthy practice, but they're sort of like writing books right now It's like you do this thing once a month or every couple months And you write it take some time to read take some time to write and I saw this company pump That was basically just saying take your cap table and it lets you do like Twitter sized updates about your company So you can just like post a photo of something cool that's going on or a chart What's the URL? I don't know the URL.

I think the brand I think the app or the company's called pump I think it's my name would be public. I might have to believe it out But I was looking at it as a potential investment because I really like this idea I think that Updates that are more frequent will actually be more transparent will actually be more useful It'll be more easy to read easier to write It'll get more interaction between the investors and the founder because I can just hit the like button Or I can just write a quick reply like looks awesome or have you talked to this person? They're doing some check out this and I think this is actually a way better way to do investor updates It's basically like a private Twitter feed for just you and your investors and That expectation of a bite sized bit of content is great and it's on the play Play store.

I don't even know what the fuck is the play store is that like? That's cool Dude, I don't know anything about that. I'm looking at it now Dude, yeah, I've never been on the play store in my life. I didn't even know what that was I blue collar everyday Sam and it's like what is Android? I I I'm sorry. I don't know one person that uses Android. Do you Like developers use it I don't Andres great has great camera the pixels got an amazing camera. It's amazing I don't know one person like closely here. I thought just saw everyone just in iPhone except you have Android and you're in my group chat You're out of my group chat, bro Like you're killing the group chat with your inability to like send pictures and and all that is horrible Well, I'm looking at pump.

It's also in the app store. I actually thinks is cool There was this other company that people were were were saying was gonna be really cool I forget the name of it. You might remember it though and it was like how to collaborate with your investors better What was that called started with a C? Cup cabal. I think that's the one I saw cabal. It seemed okay. This seems way way interesting I think this is better that cabal has a bunch of like cool people using it and invested in it So it might have like the important people doing that, but how did you find that? I like this product better How did you find this dude? I have a lot of help when Zach found this one For for Oz found the Billy of the week and sent it to me because he'd been on the guys yacht and sent me a picture of it It was like you got a feature this guy It's a lot of my ideas don't come for me.

Wow. No, that's amazing. I would I would invest in that company Yeah, I think that's really cool If you're the founder hit us up we want it we want to invest in that all right You want to do one more thing or you want to save it? We should save it this episode is gonna be a little crazy. We'll see if it's interesting. Oh, um, you want to talk about my influencer update? Yeah You're like, let's save it, but I want to talk about this well cuz this that's actually not important So we could hide it at the end This is actually what I was gonna start with because I found this hilarious and awesome I wanted to know what you're actually doing because like you said it as a joke.

So Sam texts the other day goes I Think I think you were joking, but you're like half serious. No, I was not maybe You were not serious or not joking. I think I was serious. You're more serious than So Sam text I'm thinking about stopping trying to be a business influencer and just go to be a fitness influencer I don't know if my face is good enough though And so then I'm like, okay, just kind of random funny text didn't think much of it And then you sent me this link to this reddit post where you're like my fitness journey You know, I hear I'm at you know 12% body fat and here's my photos and here's what I'm doing I'm like, oh shit.

He's actually trying to do it. So what is this? What are you doing? So did you see my Instagram thing? The video yeah, I saw your video. Yeah, so here's why I think it's cool I love exercise. I love to work out and I'm a little Board of just business content and I look up so you want to know what I we're gonna talk about this next episode But here's what I do late at night late at night. I go to Instagram and I love watching videos of ripped guys stretch Do you ever watch? Like no, no, I never do that.

I go on Dude, there's these guys. This is like getting really popular right now There's these dudes who they do calisthenics and they're like sitting on like these bars and they like move their legs above their head Or they they like do the splits or and they're not like jacked like dudes but they're like skinny ish very flexible and I'm like, this is the way to live life 100% to be skinny and flexible and there's I just I just in my head I'm like, they're just stretching all day and filming it. That seems awesome I can do that and so that's kind of like how I want to live my life right now is I like watch these guys do like You know what your thoracic thoracic spine is? Yes, like it's upper back So because like we sit hunched over like everyone's got like a hunchback kind of and so the thoracic It's like I think it's really good to stretch and so I just watch videos of guys stretch your thoracic spine I love Nick bear Nick bear was this huge beast of a guy who came on our podcast And he has this like pretty cool business and he just like runs marathon and lifts weights all day and I see this and I'm like That sounds awesome.

I totally want to do that. Also, additionally, I'm a little I got a little once like we sold the company I got a little depressed because I was like I live such a soft pussy life Like I don't have any real threats in my life. I never have to fight. I never have to get like I never got to go hunt for My food. I never am like afraid of getting eaten by a lion like I need some action and adventure Yeah, I'm too comfortable and so I was like this fitness thing seems cool Like let's just learn how to box or let's just do something like interesting and just document it and I've loved it And so I am not joking.

I think I might do this But when you say might do this, what does that actually mean? You're going to try to literally become a fitness influencer meaning like you want to be Sam You know Sammy hamstrings who's got like amazingly amazing hamstring hamstring stretches or like what do you actually want? What is the goal? I think I could build a large following. I don't I Besides like checking like other people's pictures. I don't post on Instagram at all and for some reason I have like 5000 followers So I think that's a good base. I think I could build up this like reputation as this like fitness slash business E type of guy Okay fitness slash business, but you're talking specifically about stretching or no any any fitness is fine I'm going to focus on boxing and weightlifting right now because that's what I love But I think stretching is like the way to go.

Yes. I'd like there's so many people who Google Different stretching stuff dude. I'm telling you this this whole mobility movement. It's huge And how committed are you to this? I mean I work out constantly like so to the influencer part. I know you're committed to a to doing the fitness stuff I haven't decided how Committed I am because Well, what was the reaction to your reddit and Instagram thing? Is that probably just gave you a bunch of jet fuel of motivation to keep going? Well, it was good. I mean the reddit the thing the reddit was interesting I'll just post it on a subreddit called guess my body fat and like people but then I wasn't caring about that when I told you What I was caring about is that someone said your body fat is probably this I don't know about Sean Purries And I was like, oh my god, that's crazy.

Someone like recognizes us and so but the Instagram thing that I posted it got popular But the thing is is that I actually think that like getting famous on social media is really cool and also it will make you very unhappy And so that's my biggest thing the biggest thing I'm nervous about is like do I actually want to spend time on this and go down this like Heed and this stick like, you know Dedicating my life to something that maybe isn't actually that cool or important, but it does seem kind of neat. So anyway, that's my rant on becoming a fitness influencer I think I could do it.

I think I'd like have girl next door like a girl next door body You know what I mean like not like that's so true. It's like not intimidating You're not on it. You're not unachievable, but you're also impressive. So it's like, yeah, I'm into it I'm into it, but I feel like with enough work I too could be there. Yeah, I got like just a regular guy I got girl next door abs like you know like you can do it too And you have been doing it by the way you look great Well, I'm trying but I'm I'm far behind where you're at and yeah, but I had a head start It would have been fun if like when I saw you post that thing I was like, oh damn.

Okay. So I've been doing this for one year now Steps to do this for a while. Okay. Let me see. You know, it sort of put into perspective like Actually the girl the guy next door thing you said is so true because that's actually the feeling I had which was I was like You know when I look at random people on Instagram that are really ripped it doesn't do anything for me because I'm like Well, I'm not trying to do that. I'm not trying to be a gorilla Like I'm not trying to like have 19, you know 19 abs but like for for nice abs That seems like both achievable and desirable to me.

So I actually think you're on to something with this guy next door vibe This one's saying it's like everything our podcast. People say, oh you guys make everything seem so easy and achievable And I'm like, and what do we say? We're like, it kind of is you got to put in the work but like it's not that hard intellectually Yeah, because we're not that smart nor are we that successful nor are we that nor do we do that much research So there's there's a A relate ability to us to us. We're not smarter than you.

We're not that much more successful than you and we definitely don't do a ton of research on each individual topic so we're not that much more of an expert than you on any topic. So this is my thing. I might just translate that to like getting shredded and being fit and like living a long healthy life. That's why it's interesting to me. Also the same way that whenever you post stuff like people send you free shit like that drink company or like you know you have you have a lot of like people who email you with amazing opportunities it would be cool to get that for a workout related stuff so that's one of the reasons why I want to do it.

Did I show you this? Have I shown you this? It's an axe. I'm holding up an axe for those who are just listening not on the YouTube channel and it's called Chop Fit. So this guy sent me this. Dude what the fuck? I don't get shit. I don't get anything. Bro there's a method to the madness. I think we asked for it or we told him like I saw this thing and we messaged him and be like hey this is awesome. He's like oh I'd love to send you one. It's really what I do. I basically just have a bunch of DMs that are for products I think are cool and I just say yo Chop Fit looks dope.

Congrats you know like something like that and they're like oh thank you that's amazing and I'm like yeah I'd love to try it. Yeah I'm excited to try it. Oh my god. I just let him fill it in with like yeah here you go. Anyway so he sent me this. I'm looking at the website. This is a weighted axe. So it's basically Peloton. The reason I'm showing you this. Dude isn't this just a sledgehammer. It's yeah but it's like there's two of these. So you get two of these. So you have two of these to work out with.

One in each hand and it's sort of like a Peloton but like okay like I like the idea of Peloton. I like the idea of guided classes but I'm not into biking. I don't love biking. I don't love running on a treadmill. So like I have the Aquabag boxing bag in my garage because I love hitting the Aquabag. It's like super fun to me. I love Aquabags too. So that's really cool and then this is the new toy I'm starting to play with which is like I like swinging this thing around. There's something that feels fun about this.

It feels like I'm about to like kill somebody and you can get a pretty sick core workout with this thing and like kind of it also works the forearms really well too because you're holding an axe which is like. Do you ever seen like a lumberjack? Those guys arms are their forearms are insane. Do me a favor tonight or tomorrow whenever you're gonna go work out again just do it shirtless. Do it outside in the sun and take a video of you doing this and post it on Twitter and I promise you it'll get at least 25,000 views.

People are gonna like comment to you and it's gonna comment about you and it's gonna feel awesome. You're gonna become a fitness influencer too. I work out with no shirt every day in the sun every day. It feels amazing right? What I don't do is record the whole thing. I take snippets because I'm you're going from fit to really fit. I'm going from fat to fit and so there's a big difference. You gotta be strategic right? Like you don't want to just post a before. It's gotta be like slightly impressive. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got like a montage that goes from shitty to like oh that's really good.

No in your case it's like okay. So I'm storing up my ammo for the epic montage. You're like right now you're like there's like before and way before. Yeah exactly. I'm a good before photo now but I had a way before that I've been working towards. I'm not after yet so I'm waiting for the after. Maybe that's a bad move. Maybe I should be posting everything but I think it has a bigger impact if I do the before and after because it should be impressive when you do it. Okay well this is the episode where we've just decided we're both into become fitness influencers.

I think you should post a picture of that. I don't want to be a fitness influencer but I do want to like do it to myself. I've never done this. I've never been somebody who's like ripped. If you start posting the reason why I'm doing it is I said out there I'm gonna so right now I weigh 203 pounds and I'm probably I'm 12% maybe 14% body fat which is okay. That's pretty good. I said I put it on there I want to weigh 185 in three months and a lot of people saw that and now if they see me out there eating like an idiot they're gonna like confront me and I think that accountability is actually really good.

No like like my inlaw saw me and they're like oh we're not gonna eat we're not gonna we can't go to this place for dinner anymore. You know what I mean? Like that type of thing. Yeah that's funny. Alright Ben how did we do? This one was weird. It was weird but I think people are really gonna like it. I think people like weird. I actually think the body influencer stuff was really good. 8.5 out of 10 overall. Okay all right. What was the weakest part? The weakest part? I might have just been forgettable. Was I would say probably the middle talking about like water bottles and stuff like that.

That was interesting but just the weakest. The strongest was like the energy audit stuff. Time tracking sleep talk like when you guys work. I think that was super strong. Started super strong and did super strong when talking about your like fitness journey. All right good. The Sam hose water thing was by far my favorite part of the whole episode. Is that a real thing people used to call you hose water or that was a secret? No but I was joking but I used to drink out of a hose. I love hose water. You don't drink out of a hose bro? Dude are you considered funny because I find you really really funny but you're funny in a surprising way and I feel like you think you're funny but almost that other people don't give you credit for being really funny.

I think that I'm not that funny and I think most people don't think I'm funny. Really? Oh I don't think. You know you're funny. I think people, most people do not find my humor to be. I got like a Norm McDonald's humor. You either are into it or you're not. Just so everyone has like the background that that joke that Sean told of Sam saying I'm gonna own a lake someday. He posted it in Slack and then like badgered us like five times afterwards. Like did you guys see that? Did you guys see that joke? Was it a good joke? Anybody read that? It was pretty good I thought.

And then and then we were like yeah it was good and then Ben comes and he's like Sean is really funny when you said this thing and Sam was like what the hell dude my lake joke was way better than that. Oh my god this makes our life so cooler than it really is. Future owner of the Lakers, future owner of a lake. Alright we're out here.
