Duration: 1 hours, 3 minutes, 23 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

We good. What's up? What's going on? Nice to see you. Nice to see you too. Let's start off by saying this. I thought I asked everyone to give us a review. I thought that was gonna impact the rate the downloads. Sorry, I think you're gonna have to move the back. I can see it spiking because it's too close. Good. Yeah, start again. Okay, we're back. I thought when we asked everyone to leave us a review, I did so because I thought I was gonna help us with the downloads. We're hacking this process. I've learned two things.

The first, podcasting is a wild west still. Apple doesn't give you anything that you need. The second is I'm not sure that's the best thing to do. We good? That's right. We can keep riffing. We good? All right. So what do we think is the best way to get more review or more downloads, which is our goal? Subscribe. So subscribe. So basically, A, tell your friends be like, yeah, there's a best business podcast out there and B, if you go in iTunes and subscribe, that spikes us in the charts. So some people like to unsubscribe and then resubscribe because that creates the like the charts say, oh, there's more subscribers today.

Yeah, I think that's the barstool trick. So subscribe, then unsubscribe, and then resubscribe. Just do that a ton of times because here's the deal. If Sean and I don't get to a hundred thousand listeners per episode in the next weeks or months, we're gonna start charging for this podcast. Yeah, or we just get so bored. We're like impatient. We're too impatient to make it. So you have to pay money to listen. That's gonna happen. So you want to start talking about some ideas? First of all, I think we should start with this. The Twitter weight loss thing.

We should start with that. That's pretty interesting. Did you sign up for it? I signed up. I just ate a big old plate of veggies just now. Because now because I'm like, oh shit, this is starting. So explain what this is. Okay. So when you're on camera, you predict this happens a lot, but you get self conscious. But also, we are both trying to lose weight. Our friend Justin is doing a thing where we have Venmo. Did you do Venmo? Venmo him money? Venmo? So he tweeted out, hey, I got an experiment for weight loss 30 days if you want to let me know.

And you had to Venmo him 800 bucks. I did. No, just did it right away. Just to pot commit myself into it. And then he's gonna send us a blood glucose monitor. It stays in you for 28 days. 20 days. And basically the way it works is he's gonna send a nutrition plan and like a eating plan. But if you and if you stick to it, you'll be fine. But what problem is most people don't stick to it. So here's how it's gonna work. If your blood glucose levels go out of the range, like the healthy range, the weight loss range, that he's gonna prescribe for us.

So first, he's gonna monitor your baseline. Then he's gonna say, okay, cool. Here's the range I want you to stay in. If you stay in that range for the day, he Venmo's you back 25 bucks for the day. And if you don't, he keeps your money. I Love it. And he is doing this in a way where he's buying all of our monitors. Yes, which typically costs I think $300 400 bucks. If we stick to it by the end of this challenge, we've paid $100 we've lost a bunch of weight and We got paid back all our money if you stick to it.

If you don't see it So we're giving them 100 bucks. It's 100 bucks net net if you if you if you do it to the letter of the law You get this $400 device for $100 and you lost your weight. I love it sick deal And we should explain who he is. He's the founder of this thing called Kettle and Fire He also I think is one of the founders of perfect keto. Yeah, so two keto products basically Yeah, and I have no idea but I imagine his businesses collectively are in the 50 or 60 million dollar in revenue range So like he sees a lot of he says he's at a hundred million plus run rate For his two products for Kettle and Fire and perfect.

Where did he say that on his website? Oh good for him. Yeah Um, I didn't know that which is pretty crazy for a keto product. Yeah, so it sounds like he's thinking of a new Business. Yeah, go ahead and copy that. Yeah, so I like it. So what we'll do is uh, when we get the device We'll just shout out our blood glucose levels during the show I'm doing it. I also use my body tutor where I take pictures of everything I eat right and I send it to my So I ate that donut just now.

I'm gonna have to send that to them and they're gonna shame me I can send it you ate it. Well, there's some more out there. I'll take a picture of it. Okay But all I've eaten today is a donut in an orange. I'm good. All right, cool. Cool weight loss idea. I like it Justin mayors good stuff. Okay. What's up? What else we got? Okay, so last episode We had your buddy here and we he told me about this thing where He had invested in the company that's doing drone window washing. Yes I thought that was crazy fascinating and I went and researched it a bunch.

There's another competitor that's raised money and Drones, I don't think I have the right words to describe it because when I think of drones, I think of like a quadcopter. These are Things that like they look like the normal so when you're pulling up the scaffolding or when you're pulling up like the The what do you call it? It's like an elevator. Yeah an elevator up and the guys are standing on it wiping They it looks like that, but there's a robot on there that is doing it instead of people right? So it's not flying you're saying it's not flying Yeah, why do they call it a drone then because technically it is a robot drone means on our unmanned vehicle I think okay, so technically the right and so another company called sky I Forget what's called they raised three million to do this and so this morning what I did and yesterday morning is I went to I googled Manhattan skyscraper window cleaners and I found like the top three four people and I called them today to talk to them And I got and I was talking to them and they're gonna call me back.

So some more details, but my takeaway from this industry is incredibly segmented so like fragmented like small like 20 to 10 to 20 million dollar businesses and there's probably five or 10 of them in New York, right so It's like the guy Brian from 100 got junk, right? This is how the hauling business was and you know before he sort of started aggregating all these Small fragmented local players and you've always had this thesis which is you could do the 100 got junk model for other businesses Yeah, so I would do it for irrigation for lawn mowing for painting which is already happening and for landscaping right and sounds like window washing is in that vein yeah, so Maybe you don't even need these freaking drones to do it, but that's definitely a cool shtick So the private equity play is you go you buy up these businesses.

They have a book of business They do recurring revenue probably with the same buildings and you say okay I'm gonna buy this five million dollar a year business for eight million or 10 million tell me 10 million bucks Um, or you do smaller ones you buy a bunch of one million dollar a year businesses And then you could bring in this technology to increase the efficiency So they're getting 50 margin you could get 70 percent And there's two playbooks to look at if you want to replicate this the first is um Dentists is so pe right now is gobbling up dentists is dentistry dentist dentists We have friends who are doing this.

I think we have like three Is like sieve looking to doing it and then like two other guys. I think we know They love it And so what they do is they find a dentist that does two million a year in revenue and they buy the company's like 60 Ready to retire in a few years and they buy it for Maybe if it's like a three million dollar revenue thing they probably buy it for like a million dollars Yeah, basically they'll buy it at like one. I think one to two x ebita, which is crazy Yeah, so basically the pay back your money in a year or two.

Yeah, so they buy it for the dentist's salary Right times two and they give him, you know, you still keep this little piece and you keep getting your salary But you don't have to run this business anymore Uh in the sort of out all the administration marketing and they centralize it So they'll go buy 10 of these dentistry's and then they'll put They'll be like, okay. We'll have one central office that's doing facebook ads driving traffic to all these We'll bring all your billing stuff into one central place because why do you need four people doing billing because health insurance is You know all complicated and so they centralize which makes each one more efficient and basically the dentist is already playing golf two days or three days a week and Uh, they're like, look here's a you know accelerated retirement for you And the goal here is you just you kind of become a little bit of a just a marketing company and so Um, we're we missed the punchline though a couple of these rollups I think like in canada 70 of dentists, you know numbers wrong But something like that a huge percentage of the of all the dentist's office have been rolled up now in canada And a couple of them have been taken public, uh the rollups for three billion dollars name them I don't know the names.

Okay. Well, that's looking up Yeah, because i'm because Henry if you want to google dentistry rollup canada goes public Um, I would do that and then the other model that you can look at for this is old people homes nursing homes Like so many p. I mean this is like so my wife's dad Owns three senior care facilities. Yeah, and so I was looking into this because I was like wow this thing is a cash cow and um, I think it's soul crushing That's the problem with it because he was like hey, you guys want to take this over And we were just like, oh the money is there, but like it sucks I don't want this to be like my life, you know, like I think in general people want to avoid nursing homes at all cost Yeah, fuck that and so getting into it earlier than you need to was painful, but he's making money doing it How much does it make a month? It depends on the size so so basically the model is you go and you um, you can buy an existing nursing home But what he looks for is he says okay, this thing's just a nursing home.

It's got 28 beds But it's permitted for 42 And so he'll either just buy it. He'll build out the other beds And so and then the other thing is he'll buy things that are motels today So motel the room or the bed might rent for like, I don't know $150 a night And so that becomes let's call it four grand, you know ish a month and what he does is for For senior care, you're charging seven grand eight grand here in California for Each bed and you can put two beds in a room and then you could do memory care Especially, you know dementia ward on the bottom and that's like 12 grand And so he's put all the bullshit upsells into it.

The problem is is that your upsell is a dementia ward You know, so it's like All right, clearly a lot of money can be made. You are definitely providing valuable service to people Yeah, you're not scamming people. We're not scamming people. It's but it is a it's a it's a Saddening business to be in Yeah, and so for these so We're we're getting off track But let's go so so my father in law owns a moving company in New York And it's a medium middle medium sized business and it's done the same amount of like let's say let's just say some number between 10 and 30 million in sales every single year and Real profitable.

I go, well, how do you make this bigger? He goes, I'd have to buy everyone out and I don't feel like doing it I got a good life And so I would you could do that for these window things and if I was one of these Drone window companies I would look into that's what you would do. Yeah. Yeah, you you wouldn't necessarily go the oh raise VC and try to build this organically This is more of you take, you know, you take some capital and you start rolling up these businesses And then you already have technology for efficiency.

Yeah, and I know people who did this I I bunch of my friends from nationals were just the scam artists and they would do this for the locksmith industry They would do what? And so so when you roll up the reason you roll up a company is because you want to Get efficient operations. So another thing you want to do is you want to like centralize marketing? So basically if you own 20 different businesses, you want to be dishing off leads to them So they constantly have new business coming in right then and we're actually in trends We're running a report on hotels.

Brad. Is that going to go live next week the hotel thing? Okay, so we're going to have a thing. This is what Hilton does So they franchise out the hotels right everyone knows the Hilton brand you're going to centralize the marketing Yes, you central everyone knows Hilton. They buy all the ads everywhere. You go to hilton.com book a hotel Then they dish it off to their franchisees. So that's what What was I talking about? To our locksmiths. That's what locksmiths do in Nashville. But what was scammy about it? Or you're just saying these guys general scammy about it is because they could rank really easily for Nashville locksmiths and they don't give you the price and then when they get there they just see how much they're going to spend And then when they get there they just see how much money they can get out of you Gotcha, and then the locksmith who's like typically where I live.

They're all israelis And so they all knew each other from israel and they would come over and they would be like Uh, they would go to your house and you're in a pinch. Yeah, and it seems like the top 10 You read reviews. You're like the reviews and this one are only okay. The reviews of this one are kind of good it's all the same company and um, They're all the same my friend owned it right and they would all it was all the same and then They wouldn't really tell you how much the price is and then you'd get there and they'd be like, all right I bet you I can get 200 bucks and so they would charge the lady They're the customer 200 dollars and then they would give the owner just like 20 or 30 dollars.

Right. So the owner was just a Lead jet machine. That's so funny when My sister had a baby and we the baby was at a party and we put the baby to sleep in this room It was like in this like the bassinet or whatever and we closed the door so that wouldn't be too much noise The door gets locked babies inside baby wakes up starts crying. We realize the door is locked pretty panicking moment So called locksmith right away. Israeli. I don't know if there's really so it's an israeli thing This is in frisca.

So maybe not maybe not as much but maybe it was person shows up It's like this is like we're indoors. We're not this is not like your front door like complicated lock It's like a bedroom door knob and uh, they're like 400 dollars And we were like no fucking way and then they were like no chance. Well, they were like, well, it's 400 dollars I can hear a baby crying inside don't you want to get and we were like, you know Just out of principle like no and then we just busted down the door with our shoulder and like got in Because that was just outrageous.

No, it was uh, it was a good friend of mine did this he and he was from israel He told me he goes yeah For some reason like it's a trade back in israel and so we'll come here And then we get all of our friends to come here and we just dominate the market, right? It's like indians and motels. There's it's not even indians. There's a specific group of indians Who's last name is all patel pakistani indian and indians love I think indians own 70 or 80 percent of all motels and dunked donut period and actually Families with the last name patel Like they're sharing there's a book about this.

I know No, what you would Dennis Dennis So 98 of dentists I heard about this dental corporation Canada that's Is So Well dental corp has 168 dentists. What was their revenue? Are they public? No, there definitely was a three billion dollar roll up That I remember looking at and then also I believe black rock blackstone one of those two They're heavy in this business now as well Um, maybe tomorrow or friday You let's have a roll up addition because I can list a whole bunch of Companies that have done this and I'm crazy saying rather than half talking about it and half knowing it We should uh, okay, gotcha.

Okay. Let's uh, let's move on and tomorrow. We'll know everything about this industry. You want to talk about uh Can you scroll Henry? Okay, so I we can talk about Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts if you want. I'm interested in that a little bit Okay, actually here's what I wanted to ask you about. Um, this is different than Boy Scouts But we should talk about Boy Scouts This zillion beers thing what happened. Yeah, what is this? Okay, so Barstool just put a clinic on marketing on how to do marketing right. Okay, so tell me the story I don't know.

I don't get what happened barstool sports. We'll we'll dumb it down barstool sports. Um Um media company like ESPN or Bleach Report, but Personality driven and ESPN after three beers basically. Yeah, it's just like comedy. It's more. It's like SNL It's more comedy and fiction than it is Uh, whatever It's not journalism. Yeah, yeah, sometimes it is some I mean every once in a while they'll have something amazing But yeah, no, it's it's just a bunch of like it's for the average man by the average man's their tagline Okay, um, they have a guy. He's a camera guy and Henry's a big fan.

So he knows you they have a guy a camera guy named Dana Dana was getting made fun of one day like 10 days ago for drinking too many beers And he set a line like he tweeted out and he said some line like I'm just a guy who drinks a zillion beers and he starts like talking about zillion beers over the course of a day and his boss Dave Portnoy Uh was like dude, you're a camera man. You're not a content guy. Quit this zillion beer stuff Yeah, try stop trying to make it a thing stop trying to make it thing and Dana goes Dave I bet you I can sell like 30 thousand dollars.

Where's the zillion dollar beer merch and Dave goes if you do that I'll give you 10 grand or something like that and they blew past it Then after a few days of this going back and forth It gets to the point of If you sell a million dollars with the merch in the next five days, I'll give you a hundred grand right He has he hit it across that he got 1.5 million And the how long do you think that lasted so he created a brand essentially on the fly zillion beer brand called zillion beers And in 10 days sold 1.6

million dollars in merch And throughout this process Pretty much the the way in which they sold Merch was pretty much all twitter and so I was watching like as a marketing person I was looking at Dana went from having a thousand followers on twitter to whatever he has now Maybe 150 thousand followers on twitter in 10 days and he would get into drought like draw like a fights like so for example He met this girl on twitter and she flew out and they started like talking about how they're dating now Even though they just met and then the ex boyfriend starts tweeting at him and he's like all right me and you we're gonna get in a fight at Ruffin Rowdy I put a hundred grand online and so that that became a storyline There's like a dozen different story.

It was all just happening like a weekend basically Yeah, and everyone was following it in real time I didn't go out on valentine's day because I was just refreshing twitter and just like reading about all of this It was amazing. Yeah, that is amazing. I saw it happening. I didn't understand the full backstory Um, yeah, I I saw it all happening. I I don't even drink beer and I bought 150 dollars worth of zillion beer merch Yeah, just out of respect for what was going on. I thought it was great to support the cause It's like a it's like a rowdy Kickstarter that he did.

I love it. Yeah, and so I think the takeaway here is like They barstool put on a clinic of like how fast you can do stuff Yeah, and people want to be a part of something and so it's one thing to just sell merch It's another thing to be a part of something which is like oh my god once it gets the momentum of we're going for a million Holy shit. We're gonna do it. My boss bet against me helped me beat the man I think it like it just caught this wave of it wasn't about the merch obviously like none of it was about the merch It was about putting it into Dave's face.

Oh, you doubted him. We're all gonna get behind him and this guy dain of the guy behind it He's like a total bro, but he seems like a really good person and it was fun watching him like be excited watching him win Yeah, and people he put his venmo out there and I venmoed him like 50 bucks people venmoed him money collectively He got like three grand and he went and uh blew it all out a fancy restaurant And it was funny seeing like a redneck He at a steak restaurant minnet. Have you seen this guy mr.

Beast? Do you know who that is love mr. Beast? So if you don't know who mr. Beast is Um, he's this youtuber who's grown like crazy in the last like 18 months really new He's like a new guy, but he's blown past. I don't know how many subscribers, but maybe tens of millions subscribers now And uh, his whole thing is he's just like he just gives away Um money to people well like it does challenges, but like he's typically he'll give away cars So for example, he goes to a used car dealership and he buys 10 cars which each car is probably five or 10 thousand dollars So maybe he's in 40 or 50 grand on this thing and people come to buy the car and the and he acts like the salesman And the lady will be like all right this car looks good and he goes Okay here and he gives her the keys.

He goes no, it's yours Right and they film it and they film it and this the reaction It's kind of like that like it has a feel good element to it because you see people who are like no way like But it's funny He'll go to a restaurant and leave a $2,000 tip on a $10 bill And they're like people break down crying and then sometimes it's funny where he'll be like He'll take four friends who buy a Lambo and be like put your hand on this Lambo first person Last person to have their hand on this Lambo keeps the Lambo and they just for two days straight They just have their hand on this thing They're passing out and they you know he may he turns on youtube content and he's brilliant because he gets brands to pay for the whole thing So this one brand quid or quid or quid It's not the toothbrush.

It's like this like stickers trading cards thing on online. I think it's quid Um quid has given this guy, you know, they'll just put up the 50k He does the challenge. He's he shouts out quid and they're happy for it because their videos are getting like millions of views And so it's way better branded content than usual And so he basically took brand money and parlayed it into being like huge, which is pretty crazy Yeah, and he even did a thing where he raised 100 million 20 million dollars for trees plenty trees and the founder of Shopify gave him 100 or sorry a million Elon gave a million.

Yeah, and he raised 20 million dollars in two weeks Or yeah, and I have a friend who talked to him on the phone the other day To do a campaign and he was like what friend? Jason so Jason's got shout out to Jason. So he was like, you know talking to him and When he got off the phone, he's like, yeah, I talked to mr. Beast really cool. I talked to his agent or whatever And he described he's like, you know one weird thing happens Which is didn't plan for this, you know, sort of success You get the success But the youtube game is such that you kind of need to top yourself every time He's probably getting these and so he's like dude the stress of like, okay, we gave away a Lambo through this like crazy thing Next week.

What do I do like? Okay, it's just this constant bar raising which is really tough. So when we first launched our company I get a phone call from Elizabeth Murdoch, you know who Elizabeth Murdoch is Rupert Murdoch's daughter. Yeah, okay It's just a big shot and she was like, hey, you guys want to do these videos I'm launching this new thing and I need video content And I was like, no, that's not what we're trying to do. But let's say friends and shoot the shit and she goes, okay Well, I'll find someone else. So she finds someone else to do it and they started a youtube channel And that youtube channel is now called yes theory.

Have you heard of yes theory? I've heard of it. Yeah they got five or six million subscribers and I've become friends with them over the years and they have a I mean, they're like famous. They're like legit famous. I have I have no idea if it's a good business But I bet you they make they could each pay themselves a million dollars a year. So pretty good for young people pretty good for anyone and Each week they're having to do crazy and crazy shit and they've had to do this for three years now Every video is like I went to the most remote island in the world by myself, right? It's three guys now And they're like taking turns over doing crazy shit like it's the crazy stuff was like I asked my uber driver if she wants to go to Paris and we went straight to Paris and went there and now they're like doing variations of that It's like, oh my god, that's just it's like if jackass if stevo and the jackass crew had youtube And like they would have to do this every week like we were just lucky that They were lucky that the cadence was like, you know seasons of tv or a movie because when it's weekly It's just insane, which is why kasey nice dat and logan paul jake paul all these guys eventually these you know They do this daily grind for so long, but they burn out like the content burn out is crazy for sure It's not gonna happen to us though.

Well, it's not gonna happen us We just sit and do nothing I'm not like having to get on a plane and like or like logan paul You gotta like yell at someone or like go break up with a girlfriend every week. You gotta go box someone Yeah, you gotta so I got a rooper murdoch story because you said murdoch I'm so impressed with this dude. So he gets a lot of hate because like his business practices and whatnot people think he's like a Tyrant in a way He is and he is and like the show success succession is basically about their family good show so We had this opportunity to pitch rooper murdoch.

So michael who's my investor comes to me and says hey, we got invited to this thing Basically every year during ces rooper murdoch Brings all the CEOs of his companies Through news corp. So they own waltz your journal I think or new york time at new york post they own every fox and sky and then they own penguin publishing right they own Uh Realtor.com so he is the media mogul right like that's cool So basically once a year they all get together. It's during ces they go to the win And they rent out the entire top floor of win And so all the rooms there are all the execs and they have the biggest suite the penthouse suite of the win And what they do is they I really admire this They go from 8 a.m.

To about 7 p.m. Every single day for two days straight and every hour is just they just bring in a speaker Um, not like a speaker. It's like a an industry leader from something and they just um, they just grill them So it's like you you start by just telling me a little bit about your business And then it's 30 minutes of q&a from the CEOs of all these companies because they're trying to figure out Okay, how do we play into this so when I was there it was like literally CEO of google CEO of slack Number three guy at facebook just back to back to back the CEO of google was the one getting grilled Yeah, he would go and he would explain here's what here's where we're going next year Because these are big media partners for them.

They they want to have these media partners working with them So they'll say here's where we're going next year And but it's off the record right so it's more candid than you're ever going to get these guys And I they told me you can just come for your slot. You know this 45 minute slot But I was like, I'm sitting here the whole day like this is Why did you get to sit there because we were gonna present at the end of the day and so we had access So I just sat there at 8 a.m.

I'm there with my seat. So here's what I noticed during the day a lot of the CEOs You know, they'd be interested in certain people but for the most part, you know, they get hungry They go to the bathroom Rupert Murdoch, I don't know how old he is guys like 80s like he looks old and he is old And that guy sat right up front with a paper and a pencil did not get up did not take a break He was the most a piss didn't take a piss. He was the most attentive. He asked the best questions He was like a machine and I was like, that's why this guy's Rupert Murdoch.

I was so impressed by this guy Uh, he's just endurance really and also just his level of focus where everybody else was wandering Um throughout the day because that's what you normally do and that's kind of contagious Did he ask but I loved how the leader was like on point because it held everybody else like closer to that standard Did he ask questions? He asked good questions. Yeah Which funny because if you're the CEO of one of his companies you're already maybe a billy and some of them might be billy And I mean you're you're you're up there.

I don't know if you've been ever. Yeah, you're maybe doing super well If you sold it, I could be like you're it was like the CEO of fox studios like oh, yeah We make these movies for this year and it's like, oh whatever, you know marvel But like it's like these are big individual brands. You're you're a big you're a big swing and dick. Yeah, big guy So that was incredible. I just thought that was really cool and I gotta give him props for that. It was very impressed That's crazy. Uh What Anything else that we go from here? Okay a different one.

Uh, that's related to what you were talking about. Anything else? I'm trying to think about what what else was important I think another piece that was that was cool there was setting his company up for success Because the media business, I mean a lot of his stuff was he literally started with newspapers local newspapers And so you very easily companies like that can miss all these shifts and become like extinct I think one of the reasons they haven't is because it probably has this learning culture and Sounds corny, but what he did was pretty badass.

It was like we're here We're not going to go tell these guys what what what the world is. We're going to be the listener We're going to be the student here and um, and so I thought that was pretty badass that he set up He architected these days which was just you know, action packed with like top top people of the world Coming and teaching them about the future and even us like why did he have us? He had four startup slots You know, it was all big companies. They have four startup slots. We were one of the startup slots.

You got grew up by him Yeah, because it was like, okay, you guys are doing something interesting was when we were doing blab It was like, okay, tell us about the future. You're not big yet, but you're growing and we think you're interesting And so um, tell us what you know that the big companies don't know and they would ask questions like very good questions like like that like what is the um If we're us that one of the questions he asked was what is what are we stupid for not doing? Like when you look at our business, uh, what do you look at and you just say you are stupid for not doing this? This is our enterprise version of trends brad Is having that nice Uh, so anyways, that's what I learned from the from these guys.

I thought it was pretty awesome God, that's badass. Who are the other three companies? Uh, one was alfred The skim was there. Um, oh, are you told me I told you about this because I was sitting there. I was like Fox is an investor of the skim. Yeah. Um, yeah, it was yeah, it's cool Yeah, um, yeah, it was yeah, it's cool. In fact, I heard the guys in the back because I was sitting at the back when that was happening Is like probably not the people who were doing it um, or they weren't investors at the time and they were just like like They were like, yeah, this is cool and all but and then they were just like ragging on it in the back because they were just like look You know, here's what the numbers are here's where you know, it's not big enough yet for it to matter to us and but rupert at the front was kind of like What do we not know like about this business? He wasn't it's easy if you're a huge conglomerate To just look at everything and say you're small you mean nothing And that's what the guys in the back were doing but at the front rupert was sort of like email interesting Tell me more and like was going through these like, you know, you could tell he was searching for what he doesn't know Um, rather than the guys at the back thinking they know everything and not really being open to learning something new from the people Who are talking crazy.

Henry, can you go tell them to quit making the dog park? I could tell it's someone saying and can you scroll this down? Yeah scroll Scroll that down and then tell them to my fucking dogs barking I know that it's like eddy like saying, you want some food speak? So Shawn you can edit this go down to the list of ideas Okay, uh a little bit further or can you just shrink it a little bit? There should be way more before you had um Oh, there's just like a huge gap Before you had the the auctions.

That's right That's fine Okay, ishawn we're back. We'll edit that part out. Um So one other idea that's similar to something we were talking about earlier is this Revenge against the spam calls. Have you heard about this? Yeah? Yeah, I um tried to write about this last year because I bought one of these apps robo call Robo caller Amazing I did research on it huge business and I the one of the reasons I know it's huge is because I did research on them And I try to find everything and immediately I knew it was going to be big because it was so hard to find information on them So tell me what that business what explain what they do first and then I'll tell you about what this new guy's doing That is interesting this one.

I think it was based in New Jersey. They have many different apps one of them being robo visor. I think it's called and users like me pay maybe 50 bucks a year and If someone calls that's clearly a spammer it goes straight to their voicemail Or if it is a suspicious one, it just says of my voicemail suspicious like right? This is a spoof call right and so I know to avoid and so so that existed And this company called true caller. That's huge internationally that does this true caller True caller is like a universal caller id.

We should do an android untrue caller. It's like It's like a what's apps. It's going to be like a what's app sized exit I think or like, you know, that's it's going to be multiple multiple billions of dollars on this thing called true caller And it's not that relevant in the u.s Because we don't have the same problems you have internationally with not knowing phones people switch phone numbers all the time there Dude, I get 10 spam calls a day So apple started doing this but what this guy's doing is interesting. So so this guy, uh, joshua He has this company called do not pay I love this.

I signed up for it. So do not pay for those who don't know is Um, he follows me on twitter. So we'll make sure he sees this. Yeah, so do not pay is cool So basically it's like you get a bullshit parking ticket So, you know, like you can actually contest a lot of these because either they filled out the form wrong And therefore you don't have to pay or technically you it was just wrong You don't have to pay it doesn't work as good as you think though And I'll tell you why there used to be a company called fix it.

Yep And I knew people invested in it. I used it in the way it would work is you would register your license And anytime your car got a parking ticket before you even got to your car the app told you and it automatically fought fought the ticket in San Francisco court and You would pay fix it half the price whatever you got back out of your uh, yeah, and they would refund they would always get it Reduced right and it was awesome San Francisco outlawed it because it was just it was just cramming the system right so these guys did something interesting though They started off with that which is you can fight tickets.

There's like what else can we do? What else is like? They they call themselves sort of robin hood. They're trying to sort of take money and give it back to the and the guy's like 20 years old Very young gets a ton of press with this very smart. That's how he grows But they have other use cases for example They have a credit card a virtual credit card that you can use I use that automatically cancel your free trials So how privacy.com offers that it's a great product right and then they have a couple other ones one is Um, where where they? They contest what is it? They They have a couple they have like four different things that they can test the new one that they came out with is We still get spam calls and so what they do is twofold There's this thing called the do not call list or whatever they do not call registry And so they what if you download their app what they'll do is they'll sign you up for the do not call registry But the problem is spammers don't care about the do not call registry They just call you anyways because they know that you're not going to take the time to like go and You know enforce this you're not going to go fight or figure it out So then they ought to first they put you on the registry then when you get a spam call They give you a little credit card to give to the spammer Uh into the scammer and when they give when they use those details They automatically generate paperwork to sue them for three grand And so there's like you can sue for three grand every time they commit this mistake And so what they're doing is they're automating the like three thousand dollar lawsuit For for this robocall for the spam call thing I just think it's a very smart model of like saving people money through these small hacks I like this do not pay so this guy has that's a great segment that we should go through more of small hacks that make big differences Um, this guy What's his name? Joshua or something.

I think he's 21. He raised money from peter teal a substantial amount 10 million maybe maybe um, okay bullish or Um, yeah bullish. I think these are good. I think there's enough people that are that don't want to be ripped off in these like five ways they have like five things they can defend against and And uh, one of those is going to be like a repeatable use case. Um, that that's going to work Okay, I would say that I am bullish on the industry bullish on the product ideas the guy Josh seems like a loose cannon.

Yeah, which really Usually goes the bad way, but the great outliers end up being right Massive and he's getting a ton of pr because he is what you're talking about He loves to go and champion the cause he's great for media What is the shithead so he gets a bunch of free pr? He's a huge huge head. He's doing controversial things. Yeah Okay, so on that note, I have a note up here that says what charlie munger said about elan musk um, so it's directly related to what you just said so Somebody was asking charlie munger.

Hey, uh, you know, what are your thoughts on tesla? What are your thoughts on elan musk? Because it's one of the most like polarizing companies He's one of the most polarizing CEOs and so here's what he said. I want to know if you agree with this or not so he goes um He first said, you know, I wouldn't long or short the stock Um, I think it's a great product and he said my most important comment was this he goes Never underestimate the man who overestimates himself I think elan musk is peculiar in that he may overestimate himself But he's not wrong all the time and when he's right he seems to be right very big And and so these so that was the first thing I like that quote never underestimate the man who overestimates himself And then the second thing he said was they said would you hire elan as one of your CEOs for a berkshire hathaway company? And he goes no never he goes.

I want the guy who understands his limitations instead of the guy who doesn't um You know, I've learned this lesson in life that these weird guys who overestimate the substance they occasionally knock it out of the park But me personally I don't want to be around a guy Around somebody who's in a who lives in a state of delusion and who occasionally happens to win big I want a prudent person So I want to know your opinions on this. I feel like you're gonna have a good take. I feel like I just said exactly that so when I try to hire sometimes uh, certain people I'm like A loose cannon here could work Like I basically like you hang out with a lot of these guys I love the wild cards these like hackers because at shan's old office It had an apartment and there he would meet a guy in the internet and Literally five days later the guy would fly from Germany and basically live in that apartment and literally well Would never leave.

Like I could see like yeah, that german kid Live with you. I bet you he could have been in that apartment for five days And he maybe only brought a book bag and a t shirt, right? Um, and then he overstates his visa and he just everything is just crazy. So I like those types of people Yeah, I for sure like them and I like being around them. I don't trust any of them I expect that they will do mostly nothing But the one or two times that they pull through it's going to be massive massive massive Let me ask you for you yourself.

Would you say you're more in the bucket of You know kind of the delusional type who overestimates and themselves But sometimes knocks it out of the park or you more the prudent pragmatic person who? Um takes a realistic view and is sort of a steady hand at running a company. Which type are you? That's a good question. Or do you have both gears? I think I have both. What do you think? Adam is clearly the second type right Adam is clearly the the pragmatic diligent steady hand Not look not trying to swing for home runs all the time.

I would say occasionally. I'm fine betting at all Um, if my business goes away entirely tomorrow because we bet it I wouldn't be upset So I would say I am closer to that wild card one, but not entirely right And then with hiring people it sounds like you hire mostly for I think naturally you hire mostly for The prudent steady hand. It's a ratio. So I think you need a few of these loose loose loose loose cannons, right? And that's where cool stuff comes out of but most of the stuff that they come up with is really dumb and stupid Right, and there's also an art to managing a wild card.

You're for kind of a wild card. He's a wild card for sure um And he's steady and he um, you know what I did with him. He's out of emotional And he'll bet it all we hired him and within a few like weeks. I was like a this guy's amazing Uh and b this guy's a wild card like I can't handle him like I can handle most people in the company And so I literally separated him. I was like look Um, you need to work with people who are like you because when you work with these people They're gonna drive you crazy because they're so steady.

They're nine to five. They're no highs. No lows You're just getting what you get and I was like you will hate that that style And so I said I want you to hire your own team and only you do the interviews Nobody else is going to give their input like you make the decision. You don't there's a cto You can hire outside what the cto wants which was like pretty controversial at the time So I was like you hire your own team He hired all people who had either dropped out never went to school these hacker types that would just be up all night He because he knows how to manage the wild cards.

And so he hired a team of wild cards basically I love those people. So if you have them in your team or your company like make sure you're not just treating them the way You will because they will be very frustrated and you won't be getting the value of their like potential My friend jack jack my best friend jack smith. He's one of them sold us coming for 800 million dollars Uh six months ago. He got all the money. I was like what are you gonna do with it? He's like, I think I'm gonna go and put all it like in some major bet and I was like what He was like, yeah, I'm about to go buy that like and he had done that even before he sold that money He had a fair bit of money, but he not that much and that but he didn't have any income right on a consistent basis He would bet all of it Like at least once a month.

He would literally have like a few thousand dollars to his name Yeah, and seven figures on some like short or like a stock. We gotta get jack in consistently. He always did that Um, I I know I don't think that I take risky uh investment I don't think my In our I don't think I'm that risky Um, I put like 10 or 20 percent of my liquid assets into very very very high risk Things where it's just probably gonna go to zero um I don't think that's crazy. Yeah, that's not too crazy Especially given the age and earning potentially you have going forward.

Yeah, I don't I'll I'll do some crazy stuff, but No, I mean, I know people that will literally empty their bank account on things. Do you have any friends like that? um Yeah, I have I have friends It's not so much like the empty their bank account on things But I have friends that once they get to conviction like Sully is like this um And we should we should have him join us one of these times But he's the type where when he has conviction in something the question is not like um He he breaks all the rules of his like usual investing and he'll go and try to like Plow the money in own as much as he can Create a competitor to it.

You know like he went when he gets his mind into something and he believes there's an opportunity He goes like into hunting mode Like I remember we were investing in lamb to school and like I brought this deal to the table and I was like Hey, I think it's great for these reasons and I set up the call and like but once he got to conviction um You know the the CEO would be like, hey, yeah, you're in um, I'm gonna send you the docs in a couple days And Sully would ask me. He's like, where are those docs? Let's get those docs.

Let's text him again Let's call him and I didn't realize like I think part of it is like as an investor It's easy to get squeezed out. You never know what's going on. So you're sort of in a state of paranoia But the other part was like when he knows what he wants He goes for it at a degree that I wasn't used to and then once I saw it I was like, oh, okay. That's how you're supposed to go for these things. Well speaking of monger He once said he goes all I do is find Companies that I can invest in that require no diversification.

Like the perfect investment is one where You don't you don't you don't do any divert diversifying you put all of it into that one and I always am looking for those which You normally would never find one but you try to find ones close to it Yeah, because they go for value investing So they go for essentially what they consider a sure bet where it's already the value is already baked into what it is I don't have to bet on the future. Um, I'm getting it at such a mispriced moment that like, yeah, I want to take as much as I can of that asset because I'm I'm already sure it's worth that today And it's just mispriced by the market.

Good. Um, what time is it? All right, you want to do one more? Uh, yeah Okay, so the spam calls thing was awesome. Um, I think we should do a case study on a couple of these some of them are big Like tens of millions of dollars business and we'll do true caller True call so on trends Uh, go to trends.co and sign up and we will have a case study on this the next week or so and um So you had some things at the top so we could well we could talk about we could talk about I think we should talk about this chess thing real quick because I think it's um a good It's a good example of a mistake a lot of people make.

Um, so I'm gonna find this exact thing one second. So chess biz 12 000 mrr on 90 kids. Okay Where'd you get this? So in the in the facebook group Um, the my first million facebook group Um, somebody posted this so somebody uh, preoff they posted they said hey, I'm a 20 year old college Nearly drop out here. I run my chest tutor.com my chest tutor.com. It's an online chess academy We currently have about 90 weekly students. It's doing 12 and a half k mrr Growth has been slow and as you can imagine chess is not really like this, you know, super widespread thing.

It's niche Um question is like I really want to learn about um a new high income skill or take on another high potential project but I'm not sure where to start, um, you know, I just feel like I'm capped out here and This was like such a you are not capped out. Yeah, this was a mistake I would have made when I was 20 and so immediately I was like Are you joking explain the business? So it's a my chest tutor.com. It's basically a coaching academy for chess players young chess players And it's doing 12 and a half thousand a month.

How do they pay? What's that you pay for the training basically is it like a digital training or do you have a coach? Uh, I don't know if it's I think it's coach. I think they match you with a coach I think you know, there's some revenue split here But I would say this you're 20 years old You have this chess thing that only on 90 students, which is like 90 is basically zero Um, you're doing 12 and a half k a month, which is like extremely respectable for a 20 year old person who's been doing this thing Um chess is a niche.

Yes, but it's way bigger than 90 and in some of the comments here somebody was like, hey Um, like just so you know like the u.s. National, you know elementary chess tournament has 2,500 players That's the tournament. That's a one tournament. That's elementary school Just us And so like you're not capped out by any means. I mean, do you think that this guy could get 5,000 people to pay for this? Yes, totally. I totally agree. So what's uh, what's the difference? What's that revenue if he gets 5,000 people? Uh, I mean, let's just do the math here.

So and we get made fun of because our on the spot math sucks While you're doing the math jason lumpkin who's an advisor to me Uh, uh, famous enough. It's not famous But he says it and he told me he goes if you can get to 10 million in revenue, you can get to 100 million in revenue Right, there's these benchmarks if he says I think if you get to one you can get there's a high chance you get to 10 If you get to 10 there's a high chance you get to 100 It may take a long time right takes a long time But you can do it and his thing is like don't sell early and this is basically saying don't quit early.

So what's it? Don't get 80. Okay. So okay, they're making 140 bucks per kid And if you had 5,000 students enrolled in this you're doing about 700 grand a month a month of revenue as you know an online chess school And I totally believe this is a achievable 100% now The question is rarely like in this million a year. Can this be big enough? Typically? It's do I raise money or not? in this case Ray if you are going to raise money make sure it's under a million dollars Yeah, because likely don't raise anything. Yeah, don't raise anything and if you could own this business and pay yourself 5 million dollars a year Yeah, and and also the question is like how do you get bigger? Uh, because probably it's what you're doing The reason you're getting shiny object syndrome and trying to look for a new business idea Is because you can't you don't figure out you don't know how to make more progress in this one And so you need to get with somebody who's a little bit smarter than you like I'll help you just message me I was about to say we'll do a session.

Have you gone to the website? No, I have is it good looking? Ask them if you want to sell it Yeah, actually you're capped out. You should sell this to me for 10 grand This is worthless. Okay. Here's the site. You can do a shit business I think you should bail Like what Is a company in New York a flex debate flex debate, okay, it's like learn about debate Yeah, like strategies and stuff. This is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna dominate the grade school in the high school market with you. So chess debate spelling bee spelling bee Oh my god, this is it.

Yeah, this is it. Yeah, we're gonna call it extracurricular ink And we're gonna dominate this it's gonna call it be called overbearing parent overbearing. Well, yeah, helicopter ink Tiger mom ink, right and we are gonna this is awesome Who's this guy? What's his name? Uh, preov I think in the facebook group. So shout out to preov good good good food for thought and uh, don't don't quit man Do not quit. This is awesome. If you need help honestly, there's we're actually doing a A case study of a company called nap KNACK, which is a peer to peer tutoring marketplace.

Yeah, and um, they raised two and a half million dollars from these Some venture funds and nonprofits. They had 900% growth in 2019. They they have these big partnerships with big universities There's tons of money to make in these types of tutoring environments. Right. Yeah I don't know if you could hear brad, but uh, he just bit some good info basically sharing how big these can be if he wants to It wants any money and wants us to be a cash flow thing. I love this. I I'm very interested Yeah, I would invest if I'm getting like a monthly dividend.

Um, but not if I didn't great idea Another great one from the facebook group was this restaurant refills thing. I don't know if you saw this So somebody basically said um, and I should find their name, but they basically were like, hey, I own 14 kind of venues. I don't know if it's bars restaurants something like that and um, They were like, dude, you know, I pay airmark $1,000 per month per location Just to refill my toilet paper my hand, you know, like the bathroom like the toilet paper the toilet cover seat thing Uh, like just these like stock goods.

How big is it? $1,000 a month per location for him. How much revenue does he have? Uh, I don't know. He didn't share too much about his thing, but he basically said he's refilling it every one to two weeks from them and so Uh, so so basically one of the ideas here was if you were doing restaurant refills Um, Cisco and airmarketing giant companies that do this service and they're they're very very big And I wonder if you could go in as a local player and differentiate on one of these one of the following levels A just not shitty service because airmark and Cisco are so big They're almost certainly giving shitty service to your average venue by now Um, the other one is price and so like can you create a co op or a group buying vehicle? So that a bunch of restaurants say hey, we're tired of paying $1,000 a month for this Instead we'll pay $100 a month membership fees but get all of our goods at cost instead of with the markup And so you can have a membership model for that Um, or you do something where you actually provide like a better service You know better quality products in some way like more higher end stuff than than these things But I thought that was a good kind of like I love these ideas where it just makes you think I'm not going to go run and do these ideas But you start to see the world differently where you walk into next time you go into a restaurant bathroom And you see the toilet seat cover you're going to realize Yeah, this restaurant paid for this and somebody's restocking this Toilet maker.

Yeah, I always see him. It's called like american made Um, it's a billion dollar company. We should look into them. You want to know another one real quick? Otis elevators, right total monopoly on elevators been around for a hundred years family owned probably makes Hundreds of millions of dollars you're in profit ykk zippers. Love. I told you about ykk zippers. Didn't I? No, I mean, I just I just noticed in high school all of my zippers say ykk Yeah, and then the really good. What do you know about them? I don't know anything So I collect vintage leather jackets if it's a ykk then you can tell what year it's on a talon zipper is even higher end So if it's talon a talon zipper, it's really good.

Right and that same category is a white cone denim. So if it's from cone mill it's a great denim factory in rally, north carolina and so ykk talon and Cone mill denim. It's like the high end stuff that is the It's the accessories to all the high end stores, right? And so they're just factories that have been around for 150 years and will probably exist for another 50 or 100 years You said you collect leather jackets. I collect leather vintage leather jackets and denim. How many do you have? Probably $10,000 worth of Of leather jackets and probably Five grand worth of vintage denim that I don't wear and I just I wear them sometimes Okay, so we'll do this as the last one the top thing we had on our list was this uh, my heritage auction this like auction place, uh, which I assume is for collectors And this is so foreign to me because Indian people don't collect like I'm not gonna collect shit Like if I go to my aunt's house, there's no art on the walls Yeah, tell me about collecting and how this company's doing 850 million in auctions this year.

I will tell you okay, so in 2008 There was this guy who had a tv show called American Pickers. Have you seen American Pickers? Okay at the time have you heard of it? I've heard of it, but I at the time it was the second most popular show on cable um, it was number two behind pond stars, which is similar and the guy's name on the show was named Mike Wolf and I was a huge fan of mics and um When I lived in Nashville, I saw Mike walking down the street and I walked up to him.

I go Mike. What's up, man? Let me get a picture and if you look on my facebook you see the picture I start shooting the shit with them and I'm like Mike. Let me work with you somehow And so it turns out Mike is opening up a store national and he lets me help set him up and work there And so what American Pickers does is they go to old barns typically in the south, but barns people's hoarders homes Not hoarders. I mean, it's not junk. We call it junk. It's not really junk. It's like old motorcycles old cars Neat stuff that's neat stuff.

Yeah, and we'll buy it for $100 and sell it for $500. We'll buy an old car for $5,000 sell it for 20 And I ran the store where we would keep a lot of the cool stuff I mean at this point he made so much money off the tv show He just wanted to collect the shit because people love collecting it I would get people that would fly in from australia just to touch an old gas pump The collectors were fanatical I would sell old gas pumps that don't work and are only for decorations And people would be like is that gas pump the model a or is that one the model c like they knew What's going on? Why are they in the middle of this? Why are they into this? And they would pay three grand because it's fucking awesome.

I would buy that stuff I have signs that cost $1,000 a mobile gas sign only just to look at It's cool because it's part of history and here's the even best part If you clean it or repaint it or try to make it nicer it loses all its value It has to have patina on it the stuff with the good patina is best So if you have an old car and there's patina mean patina It's like when you have a pair of jeans So like basically Levi's changed how they made jeans in the 1950s So any pair of Levi's jeans prior to before 1950 they used raw denim and the more you wore them It would get these cool lines in them and that and the lines are called patina I so wear and tear and so a pair of Levi's Pre like before they made that change to their modern process cost $1,500 And if it has cool patina in it, it'll be two grand And so if it has any of this patina in it, it's really valuable And so me myself if I find a shot jacket, which is a brand a shot jacket My favorite era is the 1950s with the red liner Or a buco jacket.

I'll drop 1000 to 2000 on it all day And so where do you buy these things online ever or so? So you you you can buy them on eBay. So what I used to do is I used to find jackets in America that were from the 1950s And I would put them on the eBay and the Koreans and Japanese would buy them because This a 44 from the 1950s in America is no longer a modern 44 It only fits littler guys particularly the Japanese and Koreans and they fucking love that American that American shit They love it.

Right. And so I would I used to sell all my stuff on eBay, but eBay wasn't the best marketplace for it So now there's a lot of niche marketplaces and you're talking about which one you scroll up Which marketplace are you talking about heritage auctions of the ha.com heritage auctions? I've never heard of that Up higher all the way to top. So they did $850 million. They said their biggest category is coins Is it coins and I was like, oh my god people spending tens of millions of dollars on like thousands of dollars worth of coins I buy some coins.

I own hundreds of dollars of coins. Scroll down more. You own coins. Yeah, don't you think this is stupid? You think this is cool? Scroll up. There it is. Um, it's awesome. I love it. So movie posters. Yeah, so I own Some movie posters so I live in San Francisco. So I don't have too much room But if I lived in Austin, Texas where our office is I would have a warehouse and it would be full of stuff Right now blows my mind right now. I'm in the market for a 1995 Corvette Which is and it's it's like compared to modern cars.

It's not that good, but it's it's like a cool year I'll probably pay 20 15 to 20 grand for it. I kind of I get the cars thing I actually even kind of gets the the clothing jackets boots. These are red wing boots I buy them for a very particular type of reason I own a pair of boots that are like the same brand from the 1950s and it costs $800. I don't wear them They just sit there and I look at them and you feel good. It's like a museum And the coins one those are the ones where I'm just like what what is going on? Dude movie posters.

I'm like, okay. I get this is only gonna get popular. Here's why I'm so bullish on this. Okay. So um, you have some money now Um, what was popular when you were let's just let's just imagine that you're 50 now. Yep Uh, because nostalgia will be more important. I think but what will you what would you Let's see what categories of things. What if I showed you a cassette tape? A vhs tape unopened of home alone One of my favorite movies great. Okay. How much would you pay for that right now? $0 I really like to have Right here.

No, okay as art. Okay. Yeah, I guess I would I guess I would do that. I guess I see that how much would you pay for that? VH it's unopened completely unopened I mean, I probably wouldn't buy a bliss. I'm imagining. I'm in that mode. I'm $30 or $40. I'm yeah, I'd pay $30 40 bucks to just have it there It's a talking point in the room. Okay. Now. Let's fast forward 30 years Would you pay $300 if you could find an unopened vhs tape and you have kids and I hope I don't this is a note to me When I'm 50 don't do it bro.

But do you understand my point? It's cool, right? It's cool. Okay. I get it. Let's do another one Um What's a car? Uh, you don't like cars. Is there anything? Okay. Here's here's another example that came up Uh, the guy who started Oculus palmer lucky. He's bidding online. He tweeted this out. He's like who is bidding against me So he was bidding 260 grand to buy this Uh rare thing which was it was Nintendo made a playstation or something like that It's made by Nintendo, but it is a playstation. I don't even know what this is.

I don't want to look into it I don't want to research it. It's awesome. He's like, who the hell is bidding this up. I'm at 260 grand Surely, there's no other nerd that wants this this bad. I bought a pair of snapchat Snapchat spectacles. I've never even used up. They're sitting in my drawer right over here. Oh future memory. They're just sitting there Yeah, I'm just holding I'm holding on to them. I own um, that's hilarious. How about the elan must flame thrower Okay, that's cool. Just never just don't even open it a lot of people just don't even open just sit there And it's just cool to have and then maybe in 30 years.

Would you pay two or three or four or five thousand dollars for that? Maybe yeah, maybe this is why I'm saying it's awesome. I think nostalgia is big money So maybe there's a company so just to turn this into an idea a I think this is interesting And there's a whole brainstorm around how do you tap into either nostalgia or collectors and the fanaticism that they exhibit? but a quick idea here is you've seen these these apps like goat and Um and stock x like these like street wear marketplaces. So goat is like a mobile only way to buy You know sneakers.

It's like I'm gonna buy these Yeezys for two grand I'm gonna buy these rare Jordans for $1,800 and so um, I tweeted this out or retweeted this list of top 100 marketplaces by gmv so by gross merchandise volume and um And goat was like whatever in the top 20 and you know, that's how the kids are basically spending that much on these like cool sneakers And the sneaker heads are spending so much and so um, I wonder if you could do a mobile like what they did was just make a slick mobile only Uh marketplace for these rare items.

I wonder if you could do that and pick your favorite movie posters coins Whatever clearly there's a lot of demand And it's just about making sort of a modern day marketplace because if you go to this ha.com it literally looks like What I imagine a coin collector looks like Then I imagine a website it looks like that. Uh, it looks like a 75 year old Uh, you know Website that never leaves this bed dude. I think this shit's gonna be way more popular with young people I think that what I would do is Okay, like what if I have a like I'm not poor now What what did I what was I into when I was like five six seven eight years old like I'll see hogs whatever Goosebumps and yeah Like if I saw like a slime from the collodion thing if I saw the entire collection of goosebumps unopened I would love to buy that and just have it sit here.

Yeah, that's actually pretty cool. Okay. I would buy that You see what I'm saying this is how it works, right? Or like imagine you grew up with like I feel like you're explaining collecting to me Which anyone listens gonna be like duh what the fuck? But I really do feel that way. I'm like, what is motivating people to spend hundreds of thousands dollars I saw one of the posters movie or some one of the comics that was that just sold for 70 grand It's one page of a comic and I'm like, who is this person with too much money that is spending 70 grand on this one page There's a lot of people there's a lot of people and it's not 70 grand You have to think if someone's rich enough to spend 70 g's on this thing It's just like you spending ten dollars on it.

Right. Are you buying a hundred dollar? $100 home alone thing. It's like it's kind of a lot of money, but like yeah, who cares? It's fun, right? I also wonder if there's a market for for first dibs. So like Let's say you're coming out with something an album or whatever um a movie Why aren't these companies selling the first like who wants the first copy ever made of this? Who wants the first book great and just auction the first dibs and create a company that yeah just on the spot, dude That's what I do. I'm the fucking magic band And so you you you create this first dibs thing because then you create new inventory that doesn't even exist yet You sell it today.

It comes out in the future and people would bid like crazy for this first dibs Okay, that's good. We can leave on that Oh, no real quick um So shaw and I are doing this all the time. Um, but I always have to plug this if you like doing this on your own time You got to go to trends.co Dot wait trends.co and buy a trend subscription And I think what we did was trends.co slash million and you'll see a big discount and I'll tell you one thing Uh, the sleep report you guys did I thought I thought that was pretty interesting because you see these things that get hype But then you see the actual data.

It's like meditation gets all this hype Watch how sleep is growing and how the sleep interest is growing and all the different products that go around that from beds to pillows To anti snoring to sleep aids to whatever so I like that article a lot And the group I've said this a million times like all the values in the group the group is amazing Um, and I really enjoy it so so sign up, but we'll keep doing this anyway. Bye
