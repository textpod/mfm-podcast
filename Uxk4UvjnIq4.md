What what do you do with your money? Yeah, I know you got a ranch I think you live I mean that was like my house that so it's not like it wasn't like a hot like a luxury property or whatever It's not like Kanye having a ranch in Wyoming. You actually live there because you wanted to live there Sam Sam I think has some some similar aspirations But what do you do? Are you like I'm a investor you just do something boring with your money. What do you do with? Yeah Well, I spent a lot of it on this bookstore.

I I bought two buildings in this in this small town of Bastrop Originally, there's gonna be a bookstore in a coffee shop now It's a bookstore and I rent out half of it to a record store But I wanted I needed like a space to do all my stuff So up top is like my office my wife also wanted me to take all my books out of our house So that was part of it was like getting all the shit out But no, I don't really do anything. I don't really do anything with it. I just invest it I'm I like investing in things that are very different than internet things.

So most of it's like in income producer How do you describe yourself, you know, I don't do it very well You you nailed I would sort of if I had to say what do I identify as I would say I identify as a writer And then I sort of have these other things that I do in That are somewhat related and somewhat unrelated But like if I had to sort of only pick one thing or like what what do I feel like I was like Meant to do it's it's writing. So I identify first is that Sean do you remember this? Did I ever show you this coin? I used to carry around I would have it with me a lot particularly in the old San Francisco office.

I had a coin No, I've never never seen your coin. What do you do? There's two face of me. No, it was it said what does it say? Momentous, right? Say Ryan. Yeah, which means like you're you're gonna die. You only live once right? I'd like don't you love that Sam carried it around for years doesn't know what it says on it Momentous I Knew that I met like you have to live today like you're gonna die. Yes, right and I was thinking about it I bought one for twenty six dollars and I was thinking about it.

I was like, this is the greatest business of all time I just bought a Like a fake coin from Ryan for twenty six dollars It cost him it was just probably a post like a stamp just to mail it to me. So only fifty cents There's not gonna be any returns. There's no it's one size fits all and it made me happy And I carried it around and I was like this is the is that the greatest business of all time selling coins It's it's been it's been a nice business better than the publishing business, right? Like what's interesting about books is like like the new books So you spend two years of your life writing something.

It's like 60,000 words You have to you know, the publisher is taking that managing all of it So, you know, they're they're the middleman and all of it, but like that book is twenty six dollars and people if that book was $32 people would be upset because there's like a Sense of what a book should be right like this is what people are willing to pay and Regardless of how good the book is or not exactly something of this shape I pay either nine dollars thirteen dollars or twenty six right and so what one of the things As as daily stout which I started as this email list became sort of big if the idea was like, okay Are we gonna advertise? Are we gonna monetize this via advertising? Or are we gonna like is there stuff we can sell that? you know makes it a business to pay for itself and As we were thinking about stuff you could do because I came from the apparel business before I was a writer I was like we are not doing t shirts under no circumstances.

Are we doing t shirts first off because t shirts? Like are you know? Kind of cheap, you know, but t shirts are the worst business you can do so like bands become popular People build a brand the first thing they always think is t shirts But what I remember is just how fucking complicated t shirts are first off because you have to get someone to make them But if you sell one t shirt, that's already at a minimum three skews, right? small medium large if you want to extra large and and Extra small can now five skews and then you're like, okay, we're gonna do white then we're gonna do black So now you have ten skews, right? And it's in and then then they don't fit there's quality control issues all so I was like we're not doing shirts and Also like shirts Even though all of that people will only pay certain amount for shirt because we don't value it as a thing So I was think I was like I want to make something that's better margins That's less work all of that so I was just really thinking about and then one day I was at the airport I was at the Austin Airport and I was thinking about this idea of memento mori Which is like if you look at a lot of old like Renaissance paintings the philosopher always has a skull on its on his desk and so there was a Philosophical genre of like reminders of mortality and I was like it would be really cool to have a reminder of that What would that be? I was like well, I could get a tattoo and then I was like I don't really want to get a tattoo And so I was like what could I have and the idea of the coin popped into my head and it turned out to be really cool We actually use this mint in Minnesota that invented the the alcoholics anonymous chip like that you get it like 10 years or 20 years So they've been in business since 1888 Wow, that's I think I think we're their biggest customer now And That also is a really cool business that I've been fascinated with but yeah, that was it That was a close I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you about the minutes a minute in a second because I have another minute that I think you're gonna Okay, kick out of but do can you reveal how many of those coins you sell a year or do not? I don't want to say exactly how many but like 10 tens of thousands It's a lot of them and people like I'm giving a talk in marble falls next week and Like they bought one for each of the attendees so it also became it's a really cool way to take like what I'm interested in is not Like chotchkeys or like just random ass merchandise but like what our fill is what our physical manifestations of The ideas that I talk about that could actually provide Value in some way so like I have I have this this one on my desk But then the other one that I have this for my others this is this one since Tempest Fugit which means time flies This is like a parenting one.

It's just a reminder that like to be present as a parent So I kind of start with stuff that would be helpful to me and then if it works for other people It's good. I do think entrepreneurs tend to think about Digital products first and not physical products that have good margins and this so that's been really cool Well, how much does the coin cost you a dollar more than that? Because more than that and then there's also packaging and all that all that kind of stuff, but but yeah, it's I'll just say it's a good It's a good margin, but But yeah, it's a good mark not as good as a digital product, but good enough That business I feel like You know I have this phrase you you know you you are what you admire Which is like if you admire things enough you you end up moving in that direction And that's a type of business that I've really like the thing the little thing you just said Gets like the highest amount of respect for me like okay Elon can send a rocket to Mars You know Steve Jobs can fucking you know where his turtle night can do his thing But an entrepreneur who says well, I wanted to create I really was interested in stoicism So I created this free thing to give it away, and I didn't know what the business would be the traditional model doesn't really work ads It would like you know how kind of shitty would a stoicism newsletter be if it was just plastered with ads But I did it anyways betting on myself that I'll figure it out And then I figured it out first by having my little framework of like what's a thing that represents this belief that has high margins It has low headache that like I have a DTC business with over like 3000 skews So when you're saying that my body's just like you know inside just shriveling up and dying And I'm like oh wow what how amazing would it be if I had one skew that was just high margin and like I could just make that skew amazing so hearing you pull that off and You know the way it kind of like Sam has it and people at the conference buy it to me That's like you know top level respect because The creativity that that requires and the thoughtfulness that that requires is It's kind of amazing.

I think most people would just kind of declare creative bankruptcy and say I don't know I don't know how to figure it out and just never never this way I think Shopify is gonna be like the biggest company in the world because they like let people do that Do you know what I mean? Like you just come up with an idea and then you know It plugs into a third party warehouse although I have a fulfillment center here in Austin where I do some of the stuff out of the bookstore but just like that you can just come up with stuff and Make it and sell it to people is to me is gonna unlock like so much Potential and part of the reason I'm able to have the bookstore like a physical space Is that because most of what I sell online can subsidize like in person retail also? Right Sean have you heard of this story is gonna come full circle not to the end Have you heard of Stuart Resnick Stuart Resnick? No, all right.

I bet you've heard. Oh, I think I know this guy They own the pistachio company, right? Yeah, so when you go to the store and it juice or whatever Yeah, so they own this company. It's a privately owned company. It's probably one of the large Linda and Stuart Resnick is probably one of the largest privately owned companies in America they do Multi billions in revenue his he started like a security business that he sold and he got some money and then now he owns palm Wonder like the drink palm drink. He owns Pistachios and a bunch of stuff anyway, he one of his first businesses after he sold his security company made a little bit of money He bought this thing called the Franklin Mint and the Franklin Mint I knew I knew Ryan.

I knew you're gonna do what this was and the Franklin Mint Basically started out by selling coins eventually they expanded to a bunch of other collectibles But they started selling coins and up until somewhat recently They are one of the largest I think advertisers of digital and not digital Print media and so like if you would open up a magazine like a USA like a like a TV and news guide like that got things They were always selling coins and it was Franklin Mint and he sold it for like two or three hundred million dollars When he was done with it and you know who bought it recently was Tai Lopez.

Oh wow, didn't he buy Radio Shack also? And a bunch of shit. He's bought so much stuff. Hold on I'm kind of stupid what these mint okay? Is the mint literally a coin factory so they take metal that shape it into a coin of your choosing and then they They sell it or they they you know they provide it to you who sells it Is that the idea is a coin factory is that what a mint is? Yeah, although the Franklin Mint is like commemorative quarters and dollars and stuff, right? But they don't like they do like a prince do that No, but yes, they do but they got actually sued because they use like a princess Diana coin or They've done like a like a I don't know like some like famous Person that like middle America moms like care about you can buy like a coin with their face I've met this guy who has a very interesting path that like intertwines with the Silk Road and other things and He had said something like he's like yeah What I'm doing now is I'm buying these email lists of like hundreds of millions of people like the you know like the leaked Madison read or whatever.

What was not that's read. What's that? Ashley Madison email list for like a LinkedIn got hacked cool I'll take all those emails and like you can't you can't really even send to that big of a list It's like too dirty and you'll get like banned or whatever But he like had some like expertise and how to send mass emails and I was like what are you gonna do with this? Like you start a new thing and he's like oh, no, I'm just gonna find people who like Trump and I'm a sell em coins I'm gonna sell coins and hats to Trump fans and I was like I was like wow and he's like yeah like if point two percent of my list Point oh two percent of my list or whatever ever converts like you know I'll just make billions of dollars passively sending these emails.

I was like wow This is the one of the craziest business plans. I've ever heard there's an argument that Fox News basically exists for the sake of like reverse mortgages gold coins and other forms of grift like you if you watch Fox News just the commercials you get a sense of like Just how dumb the audience is to be perfectly honest and then you realize why the content It's almost as if like I heard this great thing about spam They were saying like like you know you get an email from like a Nigerian scammer and you're like oh, this is obviously spam That's because it's not for you right? It's for someone who's dumb enough to not be bothered by how all the red flags that are there and so well even further it's They want people who after they get scammed won't really know how to like have any recourse Yes, so they won't be able to get back at you and so they filter out all the people who have like lawyers Yeah So when you watch Fox News and you get the sense Oh this exists to create the kind of customer that would fall for these like Obscenely high margin almost criminal enterprises.

I know this is an exaggeration But but like right on this side of what's legal or not businesses that tend to exploit not very smart or savvy people That's why the content is what it is It's to set up the commercial break where people won't buy real things when you turn on pretty much any other form of entertainment You're not seeing those advertisers because you're that's not who it's appealing It reminds me of in India I don't want to do a deep dive on this at some point, but there's like India has this culture of gurus, right? So like in first in terms of gods we have like whatever 50 gods So the then the gods all have like their gurus and the kind of like the saints type of people who give you know genuinely good advice But then they also kind of like do magic tricks and you're like to show that they're like, you know You know the the the man of God.

It's like he could produce something in his hand, but it's like literally an illusion Yeah, like a magic trick But the way they work is they have this like virtue Virtuous brand of being this person who only wears their white robe and they like don't have any material possessions Whatever, but when you go to visit them and people I mean there's like miles long lines like going wait like Crawling up mountains literally they crawl to show their devotion to get to this person's like thing and then you donate your gold chains You donate like gold and so these guys inevitably get raided by the government because they pay no taxes and they like you know are involved in crimes and they go they find like Tons of gold literally like the physical the measurement tons of gold in their house And they have like and then they'll like license these like chip brands and like popcorn brands and stuff like that It's like the face of this guru, but he's selling like you know potato chips Dude, big room yoga.

Vikram yoga had ketchup. I think Yeah, it's crazy. Wow. Yeah, no, it's a it's it's a It's very strange Once you get into sort of the back end of how some of this stuff works Do you know anyone Ryan who's outselling you in terms of coins? It's selling more coins No, I mean I do sometimes wonder like when when when we order like we're order like, you know A bunch of the coins from the from the mint which is in Minneapolis And they'll be like, oh, no, we're really backed up like sorry Your order will be like in a couple weeks or whatever and I'm always like who is in it who is ahead of me? But but there there is I mean so so I was thinking about it Like I was thinking like okay I wanted a reminder of momentum or it and then I thought coin And and it didn't occur to me because I had a bunch of them already So I was probably but there is a genre of there's a thing called the challenge coin that like the military gives out or police Officers give out or firefighters give out sometimes.

It's like a commemoration like you visited this place But like if you did like, you know this tour of duty and operation enduring freedom or whatever like they'll they'll often give you challenge when so I think a lot of them are like government clients or Like you know nonprofits or organizations there's like that But like I could get them done. I'm gonna talk about margins They would be much cheaper for me to make them in large books like from China But but we haven't done that. We've always used this this original place I wanted to do made in USA But then and then as it happened during the pandemic It was great because it was like we never ran out of stock of any of our products because everything we sell is made in the US That's awesome.

No, Brian, I wanted to ask you because you've done a bunch of different things Okay, so you're a you're a college dropout, correct? You You worked for Tucker Max or you consulted with Tucker Maxx Robert Green who's the kind of 48 laws of power or whatever? You've written a bunch of books. You've you own a independent bookshop. You got your coin business You sell courses on that you've done a bunch of different things. Okay, so I wanted to play a little game just to get to know you game and And it's called first worst best best last week.

Okay, and basically it's on job So what was the first job and doesn't have to be like a job. It could be like a side hustle you had So what's the first kind of dollar you earn? I worked at it I worked at a deli at a grocery store called Obexers in in Homewood, California right on Lake Tahoe And what were you doing at the day like making sandwiches and I worked in the stuff like just like a like a just a kid I was 15 15 15 15 You know just like six dollars an hour whatever minimum wage was in California then just a you know Kid who worked at a little little small town grocery and what was it like because you can make six dollars an hour I don't know how many hours you're working But you end up with like, you know a couple hundred bucks after you know a couple weeks That's a lot of money to a kid.

Do you remember like what you did with the money or how you felt about that that amount of money at that Time, you know what I don't remember what I I was super into snowboarding. So I probably bought a snowboard or something But Yeah, it occurred to me the idea was just thinking about this that I basically worked nonstop since I was 15 years old like Then I worked it I worked at Wendy's after that if I remember correctly that was a lifeguard So I've had like a bazillion jobs, but that was that was the first one and like I feel like at age like 18 or 19 Or something stupid you were like the boss of American apparel or something like just like something ridiculous or like at 18 You like worked for Robert Green writing 48 laws of power.

Well, 48 laws of power came out when I was like 11 years old, but So not not exactly, but I did I started working for Robert when I was 20 and then I was The director marketing and American apparel like in my in my early 20s So so you when you dropped out you dropped out because what you just hated school or you had something you wanted? No, I liked school, but I wanted to be a writer And so I had this I was going to UC Riverside. So I was I was working for Tucker who was at that point one of the first bloggers to have a book deal So I was like I was working for him doing like marketing and online stuff and then he got me a job at a talent agency where I Did like each I could not see you fitting in Yeah, I was like answering phones and stuff, but I worked on like new media Like so this is right like YouTube had just sold So everyone's sort of interested in internet talent.

So that's what I was working on and then The summer I was at the end of that summer that I was working there I was supposed to go back It's a college and within one week I got an offer to stay on at the talent agency to I was working for this movie producer there to be his assistant And then I'd met Robert Green and Robert Green needed a research assistant on a book He was writing called the 50th law and so Uh, why did all these people like you? Why did Tucker hire you when you're 18? What did you what did you do to get hired by him? Because at the time he's writing basically like funny Dating stories and sex stories, right? Like that was like his blog at the time if I remember correctly I think I was very young very ambitious very hard working and I was just obsessed with the internet like what what this sort of Internet culture would become And I loved books like I just I've always loved books and so I think they sense that I wanted to be a writer and They sort I sort of went under their wing as like an apprentice in You know how to do how to do what they did Did you just cold email them? So when I met Tucker because I was writing for the college newspaper and I wrote an article about him Which is what I was doing.

I would write articles about people in the way that now you'd be like Oh, I want to meet this person. No, will you come on my podcast, right? Um, yeah, but but this is before pocket So I would just interview people and write articles about them. So that's how I met Tucker I was a huge Robert Green fan. So I met Robert through Through Tucker and then the talent agency the guy who I worked for was Producing a movie about Tucker's book first book So they're all sort of connected and then it was through Robert Green that I met dove Charney who was the director It was the founder of American Apparel.

So it all kind of was all swirling about each other And what was the first kind of like personal hustle you did right? You're helping Tucker achieve his goals You're helping Robert Green achieve his goals. You're helping the talent agency find talent. When did Ryan go into business for Ryan? That's a good question. I don't know what like the first thing I would have I mean I started my marketing company in 2011 when I was writing my first book, but I think the first big bet I made on myself was I mean I'd done other like little stuff Before but the first big in 2011 I Basically quit at American Apparel to go write what was my first book trust me I'm lying So that was like the first big bet on myself and that was a hit I mean that was that was pretty it seemed like it took off right it got a ton.

I sold it for a good chunk of money for At least to me then It got a ton of attention Ironically it will it sold well, but it will earn it will probably earn out its advance By this summer which will be the 10th anniversary of it like by the The the I'm it's looking like the the royalty statement I will get in July of 2022 which would be the 10 year anniversary of the book it will Finally go from positive from negative to positive on the advanced statement What was your advance? I was too fifth it 250 it was I think it was 200 with some incentives Although when I announced it I announced that it had been sold for $500,000 because I know I knew people did nobody Actually fact checks press releases.

So Trust me. Yeah, so so the whole point the book was to prove that like the problems I was talking about in the media system in the book were real so I promptly doubled the advance when I announced it and and Nobody nobody checked That's funny. Did you So you got a big advance you didn't have that big of a following at that time How did you finagle us any advance let alone like a quarter million dollar? So the bet on myself was that I I left and I wrote the book first almost all nonfiction is sold With a proposal and then you go write the book But I didn't I didn't necessarily need to do that.

So I wrote the book. So I had what was like I had I had it's like I had a good piece of property Like I wrote something that was like unlike all the other books at that time that I don't think really there's been that many books like it or that I would maybe um Chaos monkeys would be another like similar book that I'd sort of which I thought was good But but so I sold it that way. So I wrote it so that I had it But it was mostly just all the authors that I knew I sort of got in because I I'd worked for Tucker I'd worked for Robert.

I'd worked for Tim Ferriss at that point So I had a pretty good sort of Rolodex of people who got me in the door when I when I sold that book Are you still doing the deals now those type of deals now with all your latest books or are you self? I'm still at the same publisher actually. I've done all my books with the same publisher I've self published a children's book and then I've self published two high end editions of traditionally published books that I have like I have a leather edition of The daily stoic and the obstacles the way but other than that everything's been traditionally published I guess I own the audio rights to why is that just like from the outside, you know, I think a lot of entrepreneurs fill this way It's like oh publishing, you know record labels and book publishers It's all just middlemen and they're the take advantage and the authors see so little to you know, blah blah blah and And someone like you you have a a lot of business sense be yeah now have a track record see you have an independent audience You can sell to So there must be some reason that you say no actually people don't get it that you do want to publish it for these reasons I look at it on a case by case basis.

You're just you're really doing the math Will Will be what they're paying for it plus the royalty What what are you? Thinking you earn, you know in a short amount of time or you know in a certain amount of time So I just do the math on each project So every time I think about a book just because I have a publisher if obviously no one was interested in publishing it There would be a different story But I you know I conceive of what the book is and then I take it out my publisher has a first look deal at my books I and I see what you know what they what they think what they're willing to pay and then you know I have an agent and so we obviously try to get that number up as high as possible And then once I have that number then I think okay What would this look like if I did it myself? So what would it cost me to do it myself? What am I likely to sell myself? how much work is that going to be how much of a distraction is that going to be and And 90% of the time you know the math the math tends to go towards traditional publishing in my experience The the kids book that I did the publisher just wasn't Wasn't it like wasn't in their wheelhouse.

They didn't totally get the project But So I did it myself It's been great and really fun and artistically fulfilling but also just an incredible amount of work I mean like the coins I sell directly from my store, right? The manufacturer makes them they drop it off at the warehouse they get shipped Fulfilling books through Amazon is like in like and then also the thousand Independent retailers in the United States plus every international edition, you know is extraordinarily logistically difficult And I remember you you gave this talk one time That was awesome where you showed a chart of the sales of your book versus the normal book So a normal book you get a peak and then it pretty much just kind of goes away But then for some of the classics you get a peak and then it goes down a little bit But then it kind of quickly comes up to the point the word even like it's pretty steady throughout Like a catcher in the rye or something like that or even sometimes it'll it'll it'll suck early on and just slowly get better Your books if I remember correctly they they popped just like everyone else they went down a little bit just like everyone else But then they like raise and we're pretty steady with daily sales And you're like that's because I make shit that can last a long time and this was actually For when you're running perennial seller.

I think you're like proving this point is is that still the case and Considering all of your other businesses is book is making books still where you make the majority of your income Or you just using that because you love it and it happens to make money and you But you make the bulk of your money from other shit. It's it's a Most nonfiction authors make more money from speaking than from books That's because speaking can be more lucrative, but it's also because most authors don't sell very many books, right? So I'm in an unusual space where My books do sell consistently and I have a lot of them So I make a good living from that but probably make more money from stuff other than books than books All in that's crazy That you're like the man and yet still it's like the other that's that's another reason to traditionally publish right so so like You're a publisher does not take any percentage of speaking does not take any film or TV adaptations Does not take any ancillary products any merchandising anything like that.

So really this the book is It's not a loss leader because people pay for books and books have value to people But like the the the ideas in the book Everything else is downstream from whether that that takes hold or not. Does that make sense? So if the book doesn't land all the other stuff, you know, doesn't really matter But if the book works all the other stuff happens and then the success of the book is slightly less less significant I think What my so so in publishing there's the front list and the backlist front list is anything Within one year That like the year of release that's considered a front list title and then it becomes a backlist title after a year so most titles stop selling when they leave the backlist when they leave the front list and Become on the backlist, but almost all of the income in publishing is from the backlist So so for me it's about like I'm I've tried to create that in my own my own catalog of like titles that sell every year As opposed to like a big book that comes out gets a lot of attention Then then three four years later I have to write another new book because the other one is like not relevant anymore It's like it's like Michael Buble or Mariah Carey writing a Christmas song, you know, you you want that Christmas hit you want that I mean, so so like my book the Daily Stoic when when my agent was like we should do a page You should do a page a day about stoicism and I was like I don't know And he was like it will be your best selling book and I was like there's no way that doesn't make any sense He's like yes, it will every new year like it will and he's right it the book sold More copies this already this January than last January Amazing what what do you do with your money? Yeah, I knew you got a ranch Yeah, I think you I mean that was like my house that so it's not like it wasn't like a hot like a luxury property or whatever It's not like Kanye having a ranch in Wyoming.

You actually live there because you wanted to live there Sam Sam I think has some some similar aspirations But what do you do? Are you like I'm a vester you just do something boring with your money? What do you do with? Yeah, well, I spent a lot of it on this bookstore. I I bought two buildings in this in this small town of Bastrop Originally, it's gonna be a bookstore in a coffee shop now It's a bookstore and I rent out half of it to a record store But I wanted I needed like a space to do all my stuff So up top is like my office my wife also wanted me to take all my books out of our house So that was part of it.

It was like getting all the shit out But no, I don't really do anything. I don't really do anything with it. I just invest it I'm I like investing in things that are very different than internet things So most of it's like in income producing real estate In which state Texas in Florida And you're just buying like what like multi family I have some multi family I have some mostly single single family and then some like vacation rentals And you have a manager who? Do you are you hands on with that is a headache for you? Yeah, I try I mean I try to have it be as little a headache as possible.

I most of them are managed by yeah property managers But but I like It's not that I think the stuff that I do will go away But I like the idea of like like my decision to write trust me I'm lying and not having to think about Needing to sell it up front There was a similar one when after I wrote trust me I'm lying. I was like hey, you know for my next book I want to do this book about ancient philosophy and they were like Are you sure you know, okay, so they gave me less than half I got $75,000 for the obstacle is the way Which is sold, you know many many times more copies than trust me I'm lying And you know obviously set up all these other things But when they came back with that offer, I was like, okay sure whatever, you know, it wasn't I didn't have to think about Whether I could live on $75,000 for however long it took me to write the book because My life wasn't set up around needing that's that's really like when people hear a book advance It can sound like a lot of money like even you know $200,000 right trust me I'm lying so it's just like a salary right for two years even worse than that, right? So I let's say I left my job and then 18 months later the book came out From from like when I left so two hundred thousand dollars over 18 months.

That's that's pretty good But like I said, it hasn't earned another dollar for 10 years So so over 11 and a half years two hundred thousand dollars is not is not great But I really I wanted that's the book I wanted to write and obviously it opened up other business opportunities But I like to be able to do my creative work and not have to think about Does it make sense in the dollar and set and this is this is how the entertainment business works as well like Almost all the money is in the catalog in owning the intellectual property over the long term, but you can't do that if you are Dependent like you get paid as an author every six months So and you're getting paid for the previous six months of earnings not like okay ended yesterday Here's your thing.

You're getting Essentially a paid from a year ago And so that's like, you know, that's a you can be living hand to mouth that way Even if you're a very well known person who's in you know, the media all the time And so I I want to be in a position where that's not the case Sean do you remember like seven maybe 2014? I think basically when when you and I were just gonna know each other There was this article that went viral and it said you can buy a ghost town in California for like 1.2

million dollars Do you remember that they was like you could buy like an old mining ghost town? Yeah, and people did a group did it right? And I think yeah, I saw you know, hey Ryan was involved in that. I think Ryan in his right. So Ryan correct me if I'm wrong You I've never met Brent's in the other room my best buddy. Oh really? Okay, so listen to this shot Okay, so Neville is good friends with Brent's I've heard all about him So if you go on YouTube Sean and you type in like ghost town Brent, you'll see this channel where this guy named Brent He's this really cool dude who's got like 1.5

million subscribers on YouTube He started living in this ghost town that he bought a while ago But just when the COVID when pandemic hit he just moved there and it it went to the moon And it's the best YouTube channel I've watched. Well, anyway, Ryan weren't you like the you and Brent were like the mind The brains behind it. You were just kind of the quiet. I was one of I was one of the investors There's a there's a bunch of investors. I think we know you probably know like half of them Yeah, or more than half But I to be perfectly honest.

I thought it was a terrible idea. I was like you're gonna lose all your money This is not gonna work But I mean I've known Brent for so long I just sort of was like one of the small token investors but I and I didn't see it becoming what it was becoming I should have like I was thinking about it in terms of real estate because Brent and I have invested in real estate in Austin before and so I was thinking about it in real estate and You know being from California was like that area is like like a pit, you know, uh Anyways, I didn't think about it as a content play and that's obviously what what it will ultimately Probably will become I Mean you could make more money off the YouTube channel than the actual any money you can make off just turning it into a hotel That's one of the things I found with the bookstore and that's kind of where where the it clicked for me was realizing that so opening the bookstore that like That making money from selling books might be the third or fourth like Lease important revenue stream or or use of the property like the office being number one the space to film and make stuff like content being number two and then like real estate being number three and then You know like the actual brick and mortar retail business being like four or five That's amazing.

So you basically are like you bought a set the set actually just kind of functions. It's like if you know, it's like It's like the real coffee It's like 300 acres in the middle of the mountains. Yeah, have you seen it Sean? No, no, no, I've never the bookshot But it's the same thing. I mean the the ghost town is an enormous set It's a set piece to film and create content and have A life and a brand that people care about, you know And so hold on so it's been many years now. So what's actually what is it today? Is there I don't watch the YouTube channel Is there like a functioning town do people come visit? The pandemic obviously made a hospitality business, you know, not very viable.

So right now it's it's mostly just in the sort of rebuilding phase They're like rehabbing all these different cabins and then he films, you know, if some videos there and they do like merchandise and stuff like that It's really but like my son like my son is like a very good guy He's really but like my son like my son is five. He watches one of those videos every night before bed. He's like obsessed with it It's beautiful. It's like a beautiful YouTube channel. It's and Brent is very endearing. He's awesome And it's crazy. I mean it's crazy that the quality of stuff you can make a one person can make with like a drone, a GoPro and like, you know, one decent like Sony camera Like you can I mean he was a one point putting out like a 45 minute video week like he was putting like a television quality show out For millions of people, you know for like a couple thousand dollars a month.

It's crazy what you can do And he went it went from like zero to like 1.5 or 1.0. I forget exactly over a million subscribers in like 18 months. Yeah I mean he got tons of media attention. It's done like hundreds of millions of views I'm very bullish on YouTube as a social network. I'm like late to YouTube ironically considering that's like what I left school to focus on Like I saw at this talent agency I signed their first YouTube client and I remember this agent coming up to me and he's like, what are you going to do You're going to commission their advertising revenue and I was like, I guess yeah and like that's like of course that that's way better than commissioning checks from, you know, a television series Because you just what you actually own on the stuff but I've seen it even with it with daily Stoic like like as an author you get recognized like every once in a while It's actually been weird for me in the pandemic because like I haven't done that much stuff and so every time I if I go out or I do something like I was I saw someone in Austin a couple weeks ago and then I was just in New Orleans and like because of YouTube and and like Instagram reels like the amount of like fans I see in person it's like exponentially different than what I was getting from like who I was before I see you on TikTok like every day you're in my TikTok feed every day.

Well I'm sorry to hear that telling me to like you know, thank Marcus Aurelius said yes, yeah telling me something some ancient dude is, you know said about, you know, remembering I'm going to die I'm like, you know, not not being anxious about the future and I'm like, yeah, actually, this guy's talking some sense. I like it and this and the video quality is really good. Like I don't know if you're I don't know what you're doing for that but like it's like a GoPro GoPro nine hero it costs $600 and you can shoot in 4k video with it doesn't even have an external mic it's like it's crazy what you can do You could do a 4k video on your iPhone but when I upload on 4k my shit never looks I think the GoPro corrects but I don't know the GoPro does incredible the lighting in the building I have to say it not something I control is quite good Well it looks like you're on like a farm and you're leaning on like you're in the middle you're like in the middle I mean the GoPro is are better for outside stuff but yeah you just I mean just put it there and it shoots like you know super high quality stuff and then somebody cuts it up You edit or you just hand that off to somebody you say I like shoot for a week and then I try to shoot I try to think about what I want them to make when I'm shooting it and sometimes I'll give notes I'll be like okay you know cut this here or whatever but I'm mostly yeah I mostly just shoot in like small blocks and then the idea is like okay so if I'm shooting in between 30 and 1 minute 30 second and 1 minute chunks okay so that goes content of that size can go on Twitter Instagram as a real can be a Facebook video and it can be a TikTok so you've got like four shot four bites of the apple there then that content can be packaged together to make videos on on YouTube so I'll take like eight of those and that can become an eight minute YouTube video and so so by shooting like these little things I get like lots of different like platforms that they can go out on so basically well so Ryan I I had I made a living with the daily email Sean Sean just released this new business that he's working on which is amazing Sean I gotta repudiate email it's called the milk road it's pretty hilarious and it's like a bit a crypto daily that he's working on with his partner Ben but you have the daily stoic which is awesome but you have this new ish thing that seems to be like working out really well and honestly I think could be like one of your bigger businesses I also think it could be bigger because you could sell it because it's not exactly like the Ryan show but it's called the daily dad to daily email slash podcast daily dad and daily stoke.

Who's who's writing all the daily dad I read them all I write daily dad and daily stoke what. How big that business or how big is the email daily dad is like 60,000 people I think it's weirdly not as big as I want it not just wanted to be but I actually thought it would grow faster than daily stoke did and it's actually been a little bit slower. But how big still daily stoke 400. Oh my god really. Holy shit. And do you advertise to grow these or what are you just through content then you capture you make videos and I make content.

Social drives a lot of the sign ups. And then the book I mean the book sold you know well over a million copies but yeah so I write both of them and then it's it's mostly organic but I'm trying to I'm having to get more serious about sort of I think some of the low hanging fruits probably been picked so I'm having to start to think more seriously about it as a business not just a content that I make man you you you. Oh my god you're killing me why weren't you advertising like three or four years ago it was so much cheaper you could go to choir email for $1 50 now it's like five six seven dollars.

I should have asked you. So you you're hanging out with people all the time that are you know super successful I know a bunch of people who know you and I think you're respected in the kind of like the business world entrepreneurial world. But I feel like the Matthew McConaughey world. I feel like you you are pretty grounded and you're I don't get the vibe from you that I get from a lot of people I hang out with which is just like more more not enough. I'm not there yet I got to go bigger bigger and and really it's just kind of like I haven't succeeded enough yet I haven't earned enough yet I want more money more success.

And I don't get that vibe from you are you just hiding it or is that the case. I mean I definitely have there's definitely a part of me that's in that I mean I've written 12 books in 10 years if I was just like oh I'm good you know like clearly there's a drive there or even some might say a compulsion. I think. So there's a part of it but I have. So I've been with my wife since we since I was 20. So we met like right as all this stuff is happening. And so and then I kids five years ago.

So I've always been a little bit more of like a normal person. I don't mean that in like a way but I haven't been like oh I'm a digital nomad or like you know I'm I'm going to go live in Puerto Rico for two years like you know like I've been more of just like a regular like I don't say nine to five person but like I've just been like more rooted in like regular people life than I think a lot of like creative entrepreneurial people I know who I tend to find are a bit more like chaotic it sounds judgmental but just it's a different lifestyle and so I think that's I think that's a part of it.

No I know what you mean like for example right now. A whole bunch of my friends are either you know like you say they're crypto rich moving to Puerto Rico so don't pay taxes they're going to Miami because I heard the actions there right now doing this doing that. And I'm just like but you know like I just got I have two little babies and I'm like the idea of moving like I mean the idea of like getting the kids into the club. Getting the kids into the car to go to the park is like overwhelming let alone like uprooting my life in some way in any way taking like massive risks now just is not like appealing to me in the same way like when I was 24 I remember I moved I picked up I moved to Silicon Valley I didn't know what I was going to do but I was like this is where the action is I'm just going to move to Silicon Valley and then I ended up getting this job working with this like billionaire dude and the office here this dope office and I remember I slept in the office like 232 days out of the 365 days and I was just loving it I wasn't like I was being forced nobody's forced to work.

The office had an apartment right. It was like it was like it had like two million dollars the furniture it was a it was a billionaire. Imagine Peter Teal's office. Yeah I wasn't sleeping in a garage like the bathroom floor was heated in the morning so your feet weren't your toesies weren't cold so you know it wasn't super rough but nonetheless I basically was choosing to obsess and like go all in in a way I was like excited about that and able to do it in a way that I couldn't as real life stuff like relationship and kids and things like I remember when Clubhouse blew up like a couple months ago or six I was like what like I was like I don't even want to go to a real conference let alone be in like an Internet room conference like it was just totally inconceivable to me that anyone would want to do it and I had the time to do it.

That's so that's sort of not been I actually like writing you know what I mean so the other part of it is is not just like the sort of wanting to have more of a normal sort of rooted life although I feel like I do weird unusual I take a lot of things in other ways living on this farm and stuff but it was also like for me like I writing to me as a calling that's a little bit different than I don't know making money in crypto or something like it's it's a blessing in a curse right it's a blessing in that it's filling it's like a purpose it's artistic it's like a thing you master there's also I think a ceiling on it you know and like you can you can be good at it there's obviously the JK Rowling's of the world but like you know but there's not a ceiling to being famous I mean you know we're both friends with Tim Ferriss and like his fame allowed him I don't know what he's worth but he's probably worth hundreds of millions of dollars because of his investment yeah I mean there there's not a ceiling on being well known and getting access to it I mean you sort of you end up in different niches right if you if you're called to be a poet you obviously be more lucrative to write business books but like you are where you are you know there's a certain amount of like you don't choose what muses visit you I know that sounds a little mystical but like you I like like sometimes people have been like oh he's writing about stoicism to get rich which I always laugh at because like again I if I if being rich was what was motivating to me I would do literally anything but this right like this is the worst possible of the things to pick but I guess my thing is like I I really like the routine and the ritual of sitting down to write which is also I think inherently a bit grounding in a way that like some of these other pursuits maybe aren't what is your normal workday look like I mean are you are you doing like a nine to five nine to five like I wake up early I go for a run or a walk with the kids whether we're at my farm or my place in town I don't check my phone in the morning I don't eat in the morning I usually journal in the morning and then I go I write usually for two or three hours and then the rest of the day after that is business other work stuff and I'm I'm done by four almost every day so I'm probably work 830 to four seems like a good I like it I try to I but I like it's important there are also I don't know to me being really great at what you do and somehow managing to be like a somewhat normal person to me is actually like a rare thing to do than to to just be great at what you like I think if anyone decided to be like Tom Brady's Tom Brady but there's a cost to being Tom Brady but like if you choose to be that I'm not like I'm single dedicated to what you do it's easier to be better at what you do than to say like I'm gonna work nine to five and be like great at what I do if that makes sense I'm used to work for Tucker Max you've then became buddies with him and you had a business together but I've never asked either of you about this you've probably it's based off of some of the stances I know that you've seen you've written some great stuff about like a letter to your dad about voting for Trump I know that you're against like some of these statues and you've donated money to that and Tucker I think has gone the other way where I wouldn't I don't want to call it the opposite because of course he's probably against a lot of things or for a lot of things you are but maybe different and he actually recently came out this article that Sean and I talked about it's called doomsday optimism and it's about how Barry bluntly but he's such a good writer that like everything he writes it seems like convincing but basically he talks about how he thinks like the American government is basically going to collapse in two to four years and how he's preparing for doomsday and it was like crazy fascinating but I what is your opinion on that I've been eager to ask you what you think about that and what if you have an opinion on it Tucker was very good to me early in my career and set me up for the success that I've had so I feel very grateful for that in a lot of ways he and I live in very different realities now I think I don't know exactly what caused that or what what the driving force of that is I mean I have some theories but a lot of that stuff that I see and read I think it probably has nothing to do with whatever he's talking about it's it strikes me as as driven by driven by something else which I've seen a lot of like I think the pandemic brought it out in a lot of people that probably we both know but I've noticed a kind of a radicalization or a an untethering from people that otherwise I would have assumed were in alignment on I've just noticed an untethering that I don't I don't know where it's going but it certainly worries me.

Is that a diplomatic answer. Yeah and I don't really like that answer because I understand what you're trying to do I think you could you could not agree with his opinion and still be respectful towards of but I understand that you're trying to like keep it you know be cool but like in one regards I could be like well I I I I understood I actually could see Ryan thinking almost something similar because he lives in the country and he likes privacy and like he you know you're like so so high IQ that high IQ people typically are like quirky and have like weird opinions but then on the other side I know like some of the things that you stand for and I could see you just laughing at that being like what are you ridiculous.

It's it's it's weird. I've noticed this sort of trend in like sort of tech entrepreneurial people where I don't want to say fads but it's almost like these idea viruses sort of enter the community and some people end up taking them to like very strange extremes. So like polyamory was one a few years ago and then crypto is one I have like I'm not anti crypto. I think there's a lot in crypto I'm invested in it too. And then then then in the pandemic there was like then there was this sort of anti vax anti lockdown anti like COVID denialism that was one.

And then I'm very alarmed by some of the people that I know in that space that are now going in sort of it's worse than a Trumpian direction. It's more of like a January 6 like end of the government like a like a toxic like we got to buy guns and I have guns but there's this like almost like like doomsday like disaster cultish direction that it's going in and I don't it strikes me as coming from somewhere other than like what they're actually say it's coming about. Does that make sense. And by that do you mean the belief is coming from some other like kind of reasons or the motives meaning like money.

Yeah like if we perpetuate this will get more notoriety will get more money will get more attention. Like you know there's some people like clickbait is in general is that right. Like I may not believe this like if you watch a sports talk show on ESPN they don't necessarily think that LeBron James is better than Michael Jordan but they know if they say it it gets clipped and it gets shared. And so there's like this. Yeah I do. I perform versus like do you think that the belief is coming from somewhere or the motive might be driving them to extreme radicalize both those things.

So I think number one all these people are very smart right. And so if you've built your whole career being smart and being a contrarian it can put you in an uncomfortable position where you're like rejecting things that make sense because that's instinctively where you go. Like this is what happened with with with Dove at American Apparel. His whole career everything he did was fucking insane. I'm going to start a USA apparel company. I'm not going to use professional models. I'm going to pay a living wage. None of that makes any sense. That was all those individually are very bad ideas but he somehow built a billion dollar company out of it.

So then when people were like you need to hire a professional operator inside you know you need to hire a real CFO and a real CMO and all this stuff. He was like no right. So he just got used to rejecting everyone's advice and it led to this downward spiral. So I think that there's a little bit of that. I think there is I think there is this sort of as people become like I think there's you know what audience capture is where you sort of get used to telling the audience what they want to hear.

And so the algorithm is very seductive. It tends to reward like obviously controversial things. It rewards you know polarizing things. And so I think what happens as certain people's relevance slips. They are more prone to it's like you know you're always putting stuff out and if what you've put out in the world hasn't been working and then suddenly you like you chance upon something as as compelling as like anti Vax or this or that that then it's like you're getting it's like a blast from the past. You're like fuck this is it right. So I think there I think there's some of that that's taking that's spiraling people.

I also think just the pandemic fucks with people said it's been a lot like we're not meant to live like this. I think it's that the other thing like in like a Joe Rogan or some of the intellectual dark web people. I'm also noticing I just like when you've been very mistreated by like say the media or just like elite culture. It's very hard for you to agree with those people even when they're right. So you end up going back to the contrarianism. You end up like going against things that ordinarily you wouldn't agree. You would totally agree with.

But from a tribal perspective. You know you you it's imagine if Trump had gotten reelected like how many liberals would have trouble with the vaccine because you would have to then agree with a Trump thing. I think we're seeing that I think this is why in a lot of men who have been sort of not media darlings are going towards some of the direction of things we're talking about. It's just a sort of like all died before I agree with those people on anything. Right. There's a there's this chart I saw that was amazing. It was in a crypto annual report and it said you know what is what are some of the underlying things that drive this like crypto is like a religion.

It's like a cult is like this very very strong. It's not just the same as like I like this business. I'm going to invest in this asset. You know people don't feel the same way about Bitcoin as they do. You know a piece of property in Dallas. And so it said it was this chart and the chart basically was on the on the on the Y axis. It was like do you believe it was about institutions. It goes do you believe that institutions are like credible or not credible. Meaning like are they honest or dishonest.

I think the way they put it. And then on the other side was are they competent or incompetent. It's like rank these institutions. It was like the U.S. government. It's like dishonest not not competent incompetent. And then it was the CDC and it's and it showed how they've been moving over time and basically every institution that you could think of whether it's universities whether it's health organizations the NIH and who and CDC whether it's the U.S. government they are all sort of traveling towards dishonest and incompetent as the general public viewpoint of them. And this has a bunch of implications is like well so people so the things that reject institutional beliefs.

So you see Joe Rogan just explode and pop you know he's bigger his show is bigger than quote unquote mainstream media. He is more mainstream than mainstream media. But his brand is not an institution and he doesn't look like them. He's a self teleprompter and so he's got this like appearance of higher honesty higher competency. And so the same thing is true with crypto which is non government money and blah blah blah. And so all these things are like on trend right now. And that doesn't necessarily make them more honest and competent but it is the perception that's.

Yeah and I when I was listing the different things the other one I put in there is I think like psychedelics is another one where it just becomes like this idea virus and I'm not saying that I have a disagreement about it. I'm just it's very interesting how these things just sort of infect these different subgroups and become almost a new it's their identity is primarily in that the the map that it's like. It's very tempting to fall into a thing where you're smarter or better than other people that sort of outsider mentality. And so I think I'm just I'm very wary of how that's affected people that I know and I'm worried it's taking some of the more fragile people into a dark potentially dangerous direction where they're just they're fucking with things that once you fuck with their very difficult to unfuck.

And speaking of psychedelics and we'll wrap up in a second here. I saw I follow. So we talked about Aubrey Marcus on the podcast because Aubrey has a crazy story because his dad like invented like the fleshlight and then he like kind of parlay that into building this awesome supplement empire. But I got this Instagram ad or maybe I saw on his page. So Sean I don't know if you saw this Aubrey Marcus the guy we talked about. Yeah he has this documentary where somewhat recently he spent I think seven days in complete darkness like and I heard maybe it was in Saragordo.

Am I getting the details. No definitely not at Saragordo. Oh I know he has a rant. I thought it was there. OK. Well for some reason I thought it was OK. I'm wrong then but did it. Am I right though and that it was like five or three or seven like multiple days in complete pitch. I have not heard about that but I am. Oh man. I like Aubrey alive. No Aubrey a long time but he I'm a little worried about him. He's a wild man. Sean you didn't see this. So what was the idea.

Why did he do this. So basically he had a night vision camera looking at him and he was in a small room with a bed and basically pitch dark and after 24 hours or something like that he kind of starts hallucinating and kind of goes crazy and he's talking to himself and the whole documentary is basically showing the night vision camera of him talking to himself and then like a voiceover and some flashbacks of him talking like what he was experiencing to that point and he was trying to go through like almost a psychedelic experience because I guess there's something where I don't know the science behind it where you're in the dark for a long time you start going nutty and have some realizations.

I don't know if it's true or not but it was fucking insane. It was crazy. The way that I see it is like to me it's like I don't care if I'm an outdoorsman if I see a huge epic mountain I'm going to be in all and that's how I was with Aubrey Marcus in this documentary. I don't care about drugs. I don't care about this guy that much. You watched the documentary or you just saw the ad? I just saw I watched parts of it. I started watching parts of it because he released like five minutes at a time on his Instagram and I started watching parts of it.

He is it's the fucking craziest thing I've ever seen. The guy's insane. You have to watch this shit. It is wild. Does he come out okay at the other side or you haven't gotten to the end? Well this was filmed like a year ago. He posted it on Instagram so we assume it all worked out okay. Well the reason I didn't buy it is I'm afraid. I'm kind of afraid to watch it but like he's wild man because I watch his Instagram and I see some of the shit he does and I'm like this is.

I'm just I'm very concerned that these people are messing with their brain chemistry in a way that it's hard to come back from and you know I am not a fan of this sort of like prescribed medicine for yourself to heal unnamed traumas. Like I think it's going to end very badly. Maybe I'm a little conservative and I'm missing out on something but I don't think you should fuck with your brain the way some of these people are fucking with their brains and I think it's going to. I think we're starting to see some of the ramifications of it with some of the stuff we're talking about here but I think this is hard to put back in the bottle.

Yeah this is wild. Are you looking it up? Yeah I'm reading about it right now. What does it say? Is it seven days? It was like days. So like okay there's a part of this I can get behind which is like you know people whether they go try to climb Mount Everest or Wim Hof getting in a cold bath cold bath every day to like you know challenge themselves to like. Like you know there's a form of meditation for example so he says my thinking was this if the prospect of sitting in the dark with just your own thoughts frightens you maybe that's exactly where you need to be.

Oh my god no. You know rattlesnake scare me too. I don't need to get bit by rattlesnake. And so for me there's a part of this that I actually like I get part of that which is like I think the more comfortable you could be with yourself and by yourself and not need stimulation not need others not need constant entertainment. I do think that that is like a direction personally that I would like to go in where I can I can be at peace and happiness without something going on. Now in this in this one I think is less it to me it's less scary than like being like yeah I'm going to start micro dosing LSD or like I'm going to go on this ayahuasca trip in the fucking forest because I heard Joe Rogan say that it was transformational to me that's like way higher risk and maybe not necessary compared to you know I guess this darkness thing is a little bit less permanent feeling for me.

But that's what they do it to me. I also just think I like break them. I think it's something you want to be massive. But again yeah maybe it is like deeply traumatic. I'm not sure. Hey you know what the phrase is. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you weaker. Seriously man. I don't I don't know. Whatever doesn't kill you fucks you up really bad. I always read these is to me these are like these are content stunts right. This is no different than jackass and a bunch of other things like maybe some people come from a good place and I'm just kind of skeptical.

About all the stuff like for example I'll give you Brian I'll make it personal for you which is like when I saw the Daily Stoke I was like oh that's smart stoicism is this growing trend. He probably likes to assistant but like you can like it without having to do all the work of creating a daily email and content around it like that is the opportunistic side of this like kind of cool niche thing. That's clearly growing and I said I don't know you right so I'm just thinking from afar I'm thinking oh that's smart.

And you know he probably recognized this growth and said OK I could build a cool brand around this thing that I like and I see is growing. And so when I see and you know so for example if I see you making a tick tock every day about stoicism I think to myself well you know I don't know how much of that is like well this content is going to work so I'm going to do it versus I really just needed to get this off my heart and share this with the world. So similarly when I see you know these stunts I think to myself well they know this is content that's going to hit and they can get a bunch of attention from it and like did he really need to do this and want to do this.

I'm not sure right those motivations get mixed. I know for myself they get mixed because you know if I've had a bunch of tweets go viral. You know I added 200000 Twitter followers last year is very addictive and in I don't know if you saw his the stand up special that Hussin is doing right now. Did you see him when he was in Austin. Yes this part in it. Did you see him when he was in Austin. I saw him in San Francisco. I live in San Francisco. So I saw him when he was here and he's got this whole part where he's basically like you know he's like I challenged you know this dictator who was doing this thing and then boom that clip goes viral.

I made fun of Trump at this thing. Boom that clip goes viral. The likes the views the followers the comments and he's just like fucking inject this into my veins. I need that next hit. So I went after the next big dictator and then the next big fish and then all of a sudden like you know there was a price to be paid for it. He talks about how he received something in the mail that was like you know some like anthrax looking thing and it got on his kid and it turned out to be all OK but like his wife was like dude.

You have to figure out how to get out of the way. You shouldn't be poking the bear. It's really important and that's kind of what you're talking about right. There's a price. I figure out how to keep that on a leash and I think about that a lot and I think about it you know even with what I do. I remember I was I was on some big morning show and I remember thinking like there's a I know what I could do to make this like national news like I know I could I've got a you know an audience of several million people right now what I what and then just going like life is too fucking short and then also I want to continue to live in reality and so I think what happens is certain people are not desperate or maybe their judgment is not good or they don't have someone in their life that's like you know that could work but what about this this this and this as a consequence and you can you can become unhinged very quickly.

Especially if there is any also you know comorbidities with like a mental illness or you know like and so it's most of the people who want to be in the public eye you're already a little you know like that and so you got to be really really careful and I'm worried about where some people I know are going. Yeah Sam as a fitness influencer I've been wanting to talk to you also about your excessive exercise and what this might be leading to. Hey man you might spend three days in darkness only doing squats just to you know hit those views.

I'm in a good place my friend I'm doing everything right at the moment. We'll see how long like it lasts. Ryan this has been awesome and I appreciate you coming on. This is fun. Thanks for coming in the name. We didn't even say the name of the book. Courage is calling right. It's awesome. I've not read that one yet but I'm going to buy it. I've read everything else perennial seller up so obstacles way. Conspiracy I guess I've read for conspiracy and trust me I'm lying and then the middle two are stillness one I haven't read that one stillness is the key and then he goes the enemy is the one I think you're missing.
