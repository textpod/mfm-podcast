I don't really know didn't look too far into it But they sent us a video they go watch Here's what we're gonna do and they recorded a video and it looks like a Casey Neistat video like the quality is like that and the Editing style and storytelling is like that It's a funny video and it was basically telling us how to how they would pimp out our stream and They keep calling it like, you know, my first million to the moon and they're like, we're gonna take this baby to the moon Here's how we're gonna do it and so they did two things He he showed how his camera set up how they do it for their podcast and it looks awesome looks way better than ours and then Also, he's then the next day.

This is like this is you know Like it's like the opposite of a job application Normally you get a job up you you you put a job up that you want to hire somebody to do X and then some people apply and then you're like Are you kind of squinting you're like, do I think this person's really gonna be able to do it?

I've done it for myself. I'll do it for you and let me make this easy for you Let me show you how bad I want this and I just thought like this is so much better than then what we've been talking about of trying To find people to do this stuff. I'm looking at is okay. Cool. His name is Dylan Jardin Weird last name I keep because I want to say Jordan. Yeah, Dylan if you're listening to this, let's do it. I'm in And you know, I don't know There's probably people at the hustle who have similar jobs But I think we should reward the hustle of these guys and be like the gig is yours to like Hip out our the video side of our podcast.

I think we should give we should give them the the chat. All right. I'm in Cool. All right, we have a bunch of topics. You wanted to talk about where do you want to start? I'm gonna start with this open salary thing. No, let's start with food because I've Was this yours? Yeah, I've thought about this for years. So I have a lot of I've got I've got something boiling up Intrude this. All right, so I'm talking to Ben my right hand man Ben and Ben's kind of like You know, I'm easily excitable. You could tell by the way I talk Ben is the opposite.

He's chill mode. He's always relaxed and But when Ben mentions things I've learned like when he says something is just like like oh, this is cool You should check this out. It's actually fucking amazing and he just doesn't say hey dude He doesn't like shake you and say look at this. This is amazing And so he showed me this thing that is amazing. So he goes check out this website or this Instagram handle my cookie dealer I was like my cookie dealer as I go to it You should click oh my god, I'm looking at it now.

I want to eat this dude. So alright So so he sent me three Instagram accounts. He sent me by cookie dealer. Click the second one one nine hundred ice cream So like one eight hundred but one nine hundred ice cream one nine hundred ice cream looks So good just like describe what you're seeing. It's incredible. Is it a pie? I don't know what this is exactly like what you would call it, but it's a it's a cone What it what I don't know what shape it looks like it looks like there's a stick So like at the top of the stick where you would have like a popsicle instead It's like a full ice cream concoction Which is like the ice cream and all the toppings and the fudge on top or whatever it looks amazing You should if you have Instagram go to go to one nine hundred ice cream there's one called the cupcake wonderland which is vanilla ice cream rainbow sprinkle strawberry marshmallow icing They call themselves they call themselves the ice cream Thirstrap slash thick check trademark and and they they have a bunch of followers.

They've grown really quickly 26,000 followers. So Ben was sort of sending me these and I was like, okay cool food account on Instagram. That's not too new What what what do I care about this food porn? He's like no no no dude I've been trying to send you one of these and I've been trying to like get these myself They do weekly drops of their stuff and these are selling out Instantaneously, so what do you mean? So he showed me my cookie dealer. So my cookie dealer does a drop a cookie drop Every week they do a random cookie drop So a different flavor or whatever and it sells out within literally seconds and they're doing two hundred thousand dollars a week They're doing ten million dollars a year Dropping cookies on Instagram and just instantly selling out and then they ship them, you know a few days later They know how many orders they get and then they ship them out a few days later kind of like, you know nationwide or whatever and There's another one Ali's banana bread go look at this banana bread, dude Just look at this banana bread.

I want to print this banana bread out and just lick the paper It's looks so good and same thing sells out Dude check check this out. So if you go to my cookie dealer calm That's the website. Okay, click click Instagram page. Are you on there Instagram? Tell me when you're on their Instagram page. I'm on it Okay, you see go scroll up to their profile and you see who where it says like the owner is this guy named Juan diesel more Morel's that click it? Oh, dude. He's like a bodybuilder This guy is huge This guy is so big He looks like if you've ever seen a ESPN or whatever bodybuilding competition where the guys are like this crazy color of skin that nobody is And he's just huge lunges.

Well, I know I can't tell if it's like the tan I think it's a black guy. Is he like he's so dark. I think it's a white guy, you know, they all like the white tan for bodybuilding Well, and then look at his wife It's insane this whole guy's life is insane is what I could see from this. I mean this guy's his steroids are You know as good as his cookies, I would say Yeah, I want the HGH drop. This is awesome, man. This is cool. Okay, so Ali's banana bread So Ali's banana bread.

So there's a bunch of these so Ben is like deep knee deep in this world of like Instagram food brands that are basically they're kind of like Drop shipping baked goods all around the country. So they have them for cakes ice creams banana breads And they're just specialists And so there's a couple cool things that I wanted to bring up about this and I know you have some stuff on food too But the part that I thought was cool is So the internet is the internet is really good at doing this which is normal before the internet You would just go to whatever's like your local whatever So you'd find the best within your local radius of five to ten miles or whatever it is That's what you would go by but with the internet whether it's news or comedy or whatever The best thing can just get distributed everywhere and so the best brand wins on the internet And so this is why you see things get so big, you know like Facebook and other other platforms because the best the best thing will get all the users and It's what's interesting is that these guys are doing this with food.

So if these guys really do make the best goddamn banana bread or best cookies or best ice cream They don't need a physical shop. They could just through Instagram alone spending zero dollars on marketing have customers worldwide like Ali's banana bread literally ships worldwide and So if you're the best at making something now, you have a pathway to become like a multimillionaire Where that really wasn't possible if you were just a local baker and whatever in Cincinnati, you know You were always restricted by however many customers you could get in your local radius So I thought that's pretty cool.

The second thing is if you think about this, you know This is like a mix of a bunch of things that we've been talking about for a while So we've been talking about cloud kitchens. So these are essentially like cloud ice cream shops or cloud bakeries They don't have like a physical storefront necessarily. They're all in the cloud and you just order online The second thing is direct to consumer. So they're going direct to their fans They're getting their fans phone numbers and so that when they do a drop They just text everybody like one picture of the new thing and then instantaneously people buy And I think that's kind of like amazing a way to go to direct to consumer You don't have to worry about getting on the shelf at you know, Whole Foods or wherever else to build your your brand as a cookie company or whatever And go ahead.

No, keep going last one is if you think about it like, you know Who's going to be the next mrs. Fields or Ben and Jerry's or like auntie and his pretzels It's going to be one of these brands. It's going to be one of these cloud bakeries Doing it on instagram building a cult following like these guys are doing and And you're going to see I predict you're going to see just like I forgot what was the name of that meme company that sold for like a hundred million dollars. They hit like they were the ones behind Dayquan and whatever like the couple of the meme instagram accounts Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah that it was about eight months ago.

Maybe yeah, we talked about it on the pod It's like I'm ready. We'll pull it up What you see it right there. You see it. I can't yeah I am GM media So so basically, you know some brand that just owned a bunch of like meme accounts on instagram sold for like a hundred million dollars I think if I remember correctly, you're going to see the same thing in the food space You're going to see a bunch of private equity companies coming in and they're going to buy up You know alleys, but alleys banana bread, they're going to buy up one nine hundred ice cream because they're going to be like Dude, this is the next Ben and Jerry's and we're going to take this this thing We're going to put it on steroids We're going to advertise the fuck out of it and then we're going to get it into retail stores on top of what it's already doing And so you're I think you're going to see a bunch of these if I could go invest in those four brands that we talked about right now I would go give them each, you know a 25k check because I think these are going to get scooped up Okay, so let's break this down further.

I've thought about this a ton. The reason I've thought about this ton is I I'm a media guy, right? By the way, is my mic good? Yeah, you're good. All right. I'm a media guy I love content and I've studied what goes viral and why for years And one thing that I've always been fascinated with is I've known people who have worked at thrillist and thrillists Uh, it started as a food. Well, they started as like things to do in New York But one of their biggest things is food and I remember when I started dating my wife, she was from New York City And I hadn't been there since I was the first time I've been there was when we started dating 26 27 years old and I went there and I would see these long like I would go to like The areas that you see in movies where like the cute people hang out where they all dress like, you know, like they dress like Right.

Yeah, like they just dress like for me. That was like, wow I feel like everyone looks like a movie star. Everyone was cool and hip But you know, I don't I don't know Madison Square Park or Washington Square, whatever those parks. I don't know. I don't spend a lot of time there But you know what I mean, uh, they would have the longest lines and I'm like, what are all these people waiting for? And it was like the latest Thrillest craze that went viral And so I would walk or through Brooklyn and everything and I would see these lines and I'm like What is going on and I would do research and I kind of I think I broke it down into I like I've like studied this for a while and I'm not studying this right word, but thought about it a lot and I basically Broke it down into the into a handful of categories and what it appears What what seems like what what happens is people have a small store A relatively like pretty like a corner store in hit parts of Brooklyn or New York where there's people who share so like college kids mostly and They create one or two things that that thrillers or BuzzFeed or someone Because all those companies are located in the cool parts that I'm describing and so ho things like that and one of these uh BuzzFeed or thrillers folks sees it A whole bunch of college kids see it and then it's creates a line and it creates hype and it It becomes like a good business that lasts for three to six months And then it kind of like goes away and maybe like it's still as a remainder But like still as a business, but it mostly like is a hype cycle whatever and I was like what is going on And so I broke this down into a few categories and I want to go through these categories because I agree with you I think this is so cool and I've tried to break this down.

So first And these are like uh different ways to formulas for virality. Yeah, like formulas for food virality Okay, the first one is make a side ingredient. So something that's normally a side ingredient make it the main thing So the best example of this is cookie dough. There's a lot. There's like this is a thing. I saw in New York Uh, there was a line out a door the door for someone sold cookie dough as if it's ice cream So it's like sprinkled cookie dough then like ice cream flavored cookie dough It was like cookie dough is the main thing another one is cheese like people do like fondues.

They have like fondue bars Something that's what else is a side ingredient that could be it I don't know if it's a side ingredient exactly, but uh cereal does this too There's there was these like viral things was like cereal bars all you do is it's just milk and cereal And that's it and you can come normally that's not a restaurant It's a side like it's like literally a side dish of a side dish And they made it the focus of the restaurant and that made the restaurant notable and remarkable for people to talk about and go to Or an eye or a whipped cream ball like a whipped cream store Just like anything that is typically an afterthought that is a topping or a side to the main thing Make that your thing.

Okay. The second one is to the have normal foods, but different colors A few examples rainbow bagels. Okay crazy popular. They're they're hype. I mean, they're still popular But they went through a cycle the second one is rainbow rainbow kettle corn. That's quite popular when I was a kid I remember a couple times buying green ketchup. Do you remember green ketchup? Yeah, dude? I love green ketchup. You get just red ketchup but green right? It was literally the color was different It's just the name just a normal thing but a different color and then the latest trend on uh Uh, or this year on tiktok was cloud bread, which is basically, you know, everyone is baking at home now It's just bread that's kind of blue and white and looks like a cloud right and by the way your side thing main thing I got another example of that But you know captain crunch the crunch berries were always just the extra and then they came out with captain Just just the berries just the crunch berries and it was like way more popular.

Yeah, or like lucky charms with only the marshmallows Yeah, exactly. So you take the thing that's supposed to be the The topping yeah the topping the second the third string thing make it the first string thing Okay, the third one the same thing but a different side Uh different size. This is pretty common. So like huge pizzas that you can't fit through the door huge sundays They call it like the kitchen sink everything but the kitchen sink in a kitchen sink or or sushi reed. Oh is another example Have you seen sushi reed? Oh, that's a chain, right? Yep.

So it's just sushi that isn't cut So just a long piece of sushi another one. I had a friend named soul you probably know him And he created a kitkat bar that was the size of like a cake Right, he he would make these things and so I've actually never seen this sold But you get the idea a kitkat bar. That's that's like a the size of a loaf of bread In San Francisco, they have this place bobs bobs donuts or bobs, whatever. Yes, and they have this humongous donut it's like this donut the size of you know, two of my head and Uh and you could buy it and then you could try to eat it and you could take pictures of it because you're eating this enormous donut boom that's the whole hook it's not special but It I mean it becomes special.

It's just a normal thing but a different size, okay Or like in st. Louis the whole thing is this is so silly how this works in st. Louis our pizza is cut into squares Right, right, right? So it's a round you kind of said one earlier about like uh sushi sushi sometimes it comes in these like boats or if you go to a beer place and they serve it in a boot Or whatever it's like it can also be you know a punch bowl. That's in a fish, you know a fish bowl or whatever Yeah, like it could be bigger and in a you know in a non non traditional like the kitchen sink in a non traditional container Yes, the same thing but different size, okay, or it could be miniature, you know, just something that You know, whatever uh like white castle mini cheeseburgers Uh, okay, so the the fourth one combined two things that are quite different.

Okay, so I've got a this is a really easy one There's a ton of examples. The first one is the cronut pretty easy The latest trend right now in tiktok pancake cereal. It's I don't even know what it There's like recipe. I don't even know what it is, but it's I don't know. Okay. Uh, look it up actually while we're talking to bray. It's probably It's probably just I don't know probably pancakes and cereal. Okay It no they uh, they bake it they call it pancake cereal It really it's just probably normal cereal made out of like the same ingredients.

They just bake it at home And it looks like the shape of a pancake same with donut cereal. Um, but there's um, uh, do you know, um, do you remember ramen burger? Yeah Okay, so there's ramen burger. There's fairy bread. Do you know what fairy bread is? No, what is that? It's basically just bread with sprinkles. Okay, so you're just taking two things that don't normally go together And you mash them just like a dessert burger Uh, right very simple or you can get a cream cheese bell pepper sandwich, right and the more More unusual.

It's you know, it's Doritos Locos tacos, right? It's uh, When KFC came out with the fried chicken bun or whatever and it was like the bun is fried chicken Um, like, you know, there's the more Shocking I would say the better in this case. Yes, you just take two things you smash them together pretty easy relatively simple Okay, the fourth thing or the fifth thing is you make Something that's normally a crappy food, but you make it fancy. So tater tots mozzarella sticks You add a fancy stick to them or you probably go the the opposite way of making something pretty Uh fancy and make it not fancy although that would might be gross But you get the idea and then the final one is you, uh, take, um Sometimes a food allergy, but this one isn't actually that sexy But you take some type of food you just make something for food allergy.

So there's banza, which is a chickpea pasta Um, there's uh, there's uh, luhelans ice cream. I think it's called in brooklyn's vegan ice cream only vegan ice cream Right, uh, or like otley is like this, right milk not made from cast boom This is now so popular that this almost can't go viral anymore But um, maybe if you chose some category that's not not typical, but it feels like a lot of these are now mainstream At this point it works so well. Here's what I would do is I would open up This was what I was thinking about doing.

I mean, I would never I don't think I would do it But maybe one day I would want to actually it seems pretty fun is I would have a kitchen in new york And I would get it in a really high traffic High traffic area and I would just every three months try to do a launch Where I launch like a rainbow cheesecake or you know, I don't even I'll just make it You're just making stuff up and then I would even what I would do is I would make I would do a ton of stuff And then just post a picture and drive a little bit of traffic to it and see what had the the cheapest cost per click Right.

Yeah, so so so what you're saying is just reuse the hype cycle No embrace that the hype cycle exists and just make a kitchen that's going to rotate every month into a new crazy concoction And people will line up every month to go try the new thing and you'll build your brand as like willy wonka when he would create You know now everlasting everlasting gobstoppers or whatever, you know, like he creates a new A new crazy concoction that you got to go. It goes a step further. So do you remember cronet? Yeah, so cronets got popular in 2013.

It was invented by a guy named dominique What was his last name? I don't know what his last name is but uh, a french pastry chef He's like a big named chef But he made cronet because he likes he was like I just want to have fun and create something new and interesting all the time And this one just kind of hit he actually trademarked the name cronet and he is like a purist He's like an artist so he didn't actually want to license it to people But he easily could have made tens of millions or more by licensing that name to someone And so there's a step further so you create the food and you got to come up with a really cute name And you could actually get a trademark and and there's licensing deals there So I think this is super fascinating I think if someone invested one year of their life to do this and a hundred grand or less They could probably get one or two hits right um, which May not be the right thing to do with your life, but if that's you if you're like i'm doing it great great good It's definitely fun It seems fun, but yeah, it'll teach you a lot I think it'll teach you a lot about business and marketing to be able to approach, you know food this way um Okay, so a couple other opportunities I see here.

So I mentioned I think you know investing or private equity I think we'll start to scoop up these brands. I think that's one opportunity The second one is I think somebody could could build a kind of guy theory of instagram food Uh character who basically just goes and tries to find the next You know who really does make the absolute best like oatmeal or whatever right like come up with like, you know Go to every category and then just hunt for the best one ever and then you do the drop on instagram You know for that brand for that for that shop and maybe you you found, you know the absolute best philly cheese steak in philly And then you you know you drop that so I think somebody could create that if they if that's what if they're a foodie and that was their thing Um, the other thing is a little more boring, which is like we've talked about Um cold chain 3 pl.

So basically how the heck do you ship all this stuff? Um and keep it where it actually tastes good when it arrives, you know, three to five days later Uh across the country. How do you how do you make it work? And so I think that there's just a bigger a bigger and bigger need for cold chain logistics Um, and and I think we've we've heard this a few times now And I feel like if somebody's working on that or somebody has one of those I would love to talk to you just to learn because I think this business is booming and I think more and more people are going to go into it Okay, do you want to hear one more food thing that we could we to discuss? Do you remember as a kid seeing these books? I'm pulling them up now called eat this not that No, what is that? Okay, so it was awesome.

I loved it. I bought it once just because it was at Barnes & Noble And it ended up like being like pretty amazing. So Google eat this not that it started as one book Uh like almost a coffee table esque book, right and on the left side It says eat this and on the right side is not that and so for example Um, it started as just like a general a general one But then they eventually went to like desserts fast food all types of that all types of stuff like that and an example Let's find an example one that I could say so it would say eat this Arby's beef cheddar classic 450 calories 20 grams of fat not this Arby's roasted turkey ranch Sandwich which has 800 calories and so it shows two things that are quite similar and it says eat this one instead of this one And if I want to say eat a salad don't go to Arby's it's saying like if you're gonna have Arby's get this one Not that one.

Yeah, or let's see if like they have like different denny different denny's breakfasts or Uh, like I hot versus denny's or whatever eat this or uh, yeah, you get the idea, right? Yeah, okay It's are you looking at you google it? Yeah. It's pretty sick. I it's been around since probably 2000 Probably 2002. I mean, I think I bought this when I was pretty young um Let's see there's a whole half a million followers on instagram Which is like to I think all these old like kind of publications like either magazines or little brands like this today They're all just instagram accounts.

I think that's the way to like reinvent these Wow, okay, so they eat this not cat eat eat this not that as of 2012 had sold eight million copies of the book Right and then they spun it up into a magazine and wow it's freaking amazing. I'm just pulling this up um Here's what I would do right now today if I wanted to get popular on instagram is I would do I would do the same thing just for instagram It's a whole eat this not that uh on instagram totally great and and the format is so good It's just a split screen So it has half the food item on the left and half the food item on the right and then it has the nutrition facts about why Why one versus the other I think a lot of this stuff is super shareable on instagram and you would grow very quickly Like I can see their instagram right now.

It looks kind of shitty like they're not doing a great job I think you could basically steal this concept pick a different name and Grow a big instagram account off this Oh, yeah, I was bored. I would do something like this Yeah, it's kind of a fun topic. Uh I'm reading all about it now. This is pretty amazing. I hadn't thought about this in forever But anyway, there you go. I think uh, uh, uh, if you did that for six or six or 12 months You could get hundreds of thousands of followers on uh instagram Um, all right, we'll switch off food.

Let's go to something else What do you want to talk about? Do you want to talk about money real quick tiller money? Okay. Yeah, what's this? I have okay Very fascinating. Do you what do you use to track your money? I don't use anything to track my money. I use excel Okay, everyone says that oh, I've talked to uh, not everyone but a lot of people here is usually the answer right here I use mint or I use personal capital or I use Right. I have mint. Yeah as well And can I ask you why don't you use mint? Uh, I used mint back in the day.

I mean, I used mint like 10 years ago So it's just kind of like one of those things that I don't have a habit of going and looking at And I don't like looking at uh, that stuff because it makes me focus on like You know Expenses and saving money here and there and I just don't think that's fun. I don't enjoy that So I went and looked at a bunch of subreddits about money Because I usually use personal capital and I don't like it for a bunch of reasons right now But when I asked like 10 different people how they track their money most who I asked maybe five or six Use excel which is kind of crazy to me because how many How many accounts do you have that you need to track over 10? Yeah Yeah, so it doesn't matter if you're wealthy or not wealthy most people like between if they have a wife or a husband You have like your checking account bank account your 401k your stock stuff Uh, maybe your home loan credit card credit card.

You probably have two or three credit cards So typically I imagine the average Joe has 10 plus so it's actually a lot to track We're gonna say if you have money and everyone I've noticed or not everyone a lot of people I've noticed use excel So I did some research. There's this thing and it's not like I've discovered this I think it's pretty popular already called tiller money and all it is The landing page is beautiful, but I'm just fascinated by this business all it is It's a if you go to google sheets and you click tools and then add on Okay, you'll see the ability to add plugins to google sheets Okay tiller money all it is is a plugin for google sheets that costs 100 I think it's 100 a year and all it does is it automatically Imports your bank accounts and any other account into google sheets and templates that they have or you can just make your own template but I've never seen someone build such a sick and awesome business off of a google sheet add on it's it's incredibly fascinating Yeah, this is good.

I like this. Um, I think this is This of all the like kind of money manager things this appeals to me more because it feels like i'm managing my own money And uh in reality, you know the thing i'm always worried about is data like I don't want my data on all these different services Like i'm not going to try your new finance app because like I just don't want to link my bank account to all this new stuff But uh, if they could do this where this was like self hosted in some way like it's just a template Um, that'd be great.

It doesn't look like that's the case, but it is sweet. I like it So if you go to google sheets right now and you click add ons on the top right once you're in a sheet You can see add ons and I actually just realized I use a few add ons the other add on I use is called super metrics um, which is uh It pulls in data from sequel and stuff like that I'm I bet you they do close to eight figures a year in in revenue, but uh, we've talked about plugins for WordPress we've talked about plugins for chrome Google sheets plugins is another thing that is super super fascinating to me and I completely overlooked it Uh, it's so neat and so I don't know what else to say other than it's cool So you you had a thing that I thought was kind of interesting that was about open salaries What is this and do you want to talk about this or or where do you want to go? I'll let you lead a little bit, but I'll uh, I it's so funny.

I'll I'll put stuff in here throughout like two weeks and Three days goes past and I'm like wait did I write that or did you write that? So all right, so we'll do it quick. We'll do it quick. So so you put this thing on here I got kind of intrigued so you you open salaries. What is it? Uh, so idea that like today it's kind of crazy that we don't know what other people make and not in a gossip kind of way But it's really, you know, the company knows what everybody makes But the employees don't know and that actually puts the employees at a pretty big disadvantage You don't know when you're underpaid you don't know if there's any like systemic bias and let's say women or minorities are not getting paid as much as You know tall white males or whatever and so, um, it's kind of weird that this is this like taboo thing Nobody talks about it.

You're not allowed to talk about it It's seen as kind of a faux paul But would actually be to the benefit of any employee to know to have transparency at as to what people are getting paid And it could be anonymized but being able to see what what other people at your role at your company are getting paid And so you would put this thing on here that colorado was going to say that hey from 2021 Employers have to disclose pay rates and ranges for job posts Um of any job that could be working in colorado including remote jobs, which I thought was kind of interesting And then we have companies like buffer and Whole Foods have been doing this for a while Buffer kind of tried to like make a name for themselves by being like the open transparent company We'll share everybody's salary and like literally you can like here's a link you can go and see everybody at Buffer's salary Whole Foods lets you Whole Foods you can see people's salary You put that in there or a brain did I don't know I haven't seen that one But I wanted to share a couple interesting things I found when I was digging into this so first Check out this this spreadsheet of buffer salaries.

I just put it in the chat Um, so you can click this anybody can google this and find it You can go and you can see that Joel the CEO is making $280,000 this year And you can go see what the what his EA is making she's making $89,000 And you can just go down the whole company roster everybody's salary is public Which I think is like pretty insane. Um, but interesting Then you have things like the google kind of secret spreadsheets I don't know if you've seen these but at big companies people are starting to like just make an anonymous spreadsheet and say Hey, put in your salary and your level and your your location here Um, so we can all like have more transparency.

You don't have to put your name next to it And um, they circulate it with inside companies. So microsoft had one google had one facebook had one and the google one the I forgot who was so some woman created this and within two days 10,000 people had put in their information and now there's over 20,000 people In the open google database and you can go link. Can you link to that? Yeah, it's right here um, I have it at the bottom um, so so so these are kind of cool and um And it's interesting how viral these go.

So then I was looking at levels.fyi, which I know you know about it Yeah, yeah, yeah It's a place to go see like you can go and say all right I'm interviewing at amazon and facebook and they they labeled me an l5 software engineer located in bay area Like what am I going to get paid how much is or I got an offer I don't know if that was a fair offer or a low offer Did they low ball me and so you can go on levels at fyi and it's the same thing crowd sourced information about what you make at these different companies and Levels if you look at their traffic, they're getting about a million and a half visits a month And like this thing is really elevated from a side project to something like pretty legit So they have like job boards now if you click at the top they actually have the thing we were talking about last episode A negotiator as a service.

So if you hit the top It's a sick little website where they have a little calculator that says, you know, what company? Where are you located? How many years of experience? Here's what you're getting? Here's what we think you should get paid based on the levels database Which is now in the I don't know tens of thousands of entries or something like that And then they basically say hey if you pay us 500 bucks, we'll negotiate your offer for you We have former recruiters from these companies that freelance with us and basically you book a time You talk about your offer and how you're feeling about it and what you what you really want out of this And then we'll negotiate for you and they show all these like success stories of like this person at facebook got 20,000 more than their offer This person got 40,000 more this person got 10,000 more And so they're taking and they just take a flat fee of like whatever 500 600 bucks.

I think and so I think there's some interesting stuff going on in this like transparency around what people are making and it really goes and like fits in my values where I think it's crazy that people don't talk about money more I think it would help everybody if we talked about money more and it would be less like kind of taboo and less Less like a big deep dark secret if people were more open about it And I think that's all right. Can I give you a counterpoint for that? Go for it I thought that that was interesting and I'm not saying how I feel because I'm still thinking about it, but Leo I forget his name Leo, but he didn't from buffer the co founder of buffer who no longer works there So buffer started with this whole transparency thing Um, that was like the whole shtick and it worked about about everything users revenue salaries everything It was it was a shtick that got popular amongst bloggers in particular.

There's a guy named Pat and he has this blog called smart passive income.com. I used to read it when I was 15 or 16 or 18 something like that in high school And he would make money by creating books and doing a bunch of other side businesses and he would reveal his income every single month And other bloggers copied him and it was a really cool thing. John Lee doomis did it all these like really cool people did it Buffer did it and that was their shtick to get popular and it worked because the buffer buffer's product isn't really special It there's so many uh different versions and they did it uh, Leo Leo said in an interview Someone was like do this whole transparency thing.

It's pretty cool Like you guys got traffic and everything do you think that it would work? And I believe I don't want to quote them because I I saw this a year and a half ago two years ago But something like this works now and it's great for us But I have a feeling when we get to 75 80 90 100 people It's not going to work anymore and it's actually going to hurt us big time And I forget exactly why but I believe steve What's that man? I'm getting all my names screwed up someone else at apple like a head honcho at apple said something that's similar He's like no the transparency thing it actually can hurt it hurts the company after a while and we tried it And so I actually think that maybe this is good for startups, but it kind of sucks after a long time because look Let's say you own a small business that does 20 million in sales And you're the business owner and you wanted to pay yourself 30 million dollars a year That's pretty shitty than if you're a $50,000 receptionist or something But that's like you're right to do that.

Why would you want to share that with everyone? Yeah, as the employer, it's not great right buffer used it to get a bunch of traffic because there's It was it was an effective growth tactic for them. Hey, if we're open about this We get a bunch of people asking what the heck is buffer and some of them will use it But uh as the employer, it's not great as the employee. It's great And so that's it depends kind of which side of the coin are you on also it depends how far you go the buffer thing Where they write everybody's name and how much they make bit much But the google thing where it's like hey, look, there's thousands of employees here I need to know that within my level within my kind of area.

Am I underpaid overpaid or you know somewhere in between? um It gives people peace of mind and and it gives them, you know an opportunity to get more Sort of fairness or equity in terms of being able to negotiate with information information that the other side has That you don't have so I like it from the employee perspective And I think it's but I wouldn't go the buffer way of writing everybody's names down now at a small company Cool that kind of happens, but I thought that was I think it's kind of cool. I think there's definitely interest around this So, you know a couple little ideas of things that people could do so levels f.y.i.

Is cool is working. Um, i'm surprised that somebody like, you know, our buddy andrew wilkinson doesn't go buy a company like this Um, it's it's kind of an end of one company. It has like a unique data advantage It's in it does job boards, which he loves as a business model on top of all this traffic that they're getting And it's kind of like a side project that's probably like You know reach the max of that of which, you know, the two guys behind it really can take it. Um The other ways that you could do this, I think you could do this in any vertical So I don't know is there levels f.y.i

in the like hedge fund world or consulting or banking Like if you're in those worlds and there isn't a tool like this You should just make the levels that f.y.i database for your industry nursing. I don't I don't know Whatever the industry is that this product can work across those Um, and so I think that's cool even within levels somebody could go further and be like, all right I'm going to take product managers or data science and really own that If they were somebody who has a big audience for that like if if that guy lenny Um, lenny who's got a big blog and kind of audience around product managers He could do this for product management and do it better than levels can generally So I think the levels concept could be exported and done in different areas When we first launched like maybe the first couple months of launching so we didn't have an audience So and I'm saying this so anyone could do it.

We didn't have an audience Um, I wrote a post called how much money do founders make because I was trying to figure out like do I pay myself? Do I not pay myself? Right? Whatever and if you google how much money do founders have in their bank account the hustle you might see it And all I did was I took a google form and I posted it on hacker news and it went to number one Uh, they eventually took it down because I think that goes against their terms of service like I have a survey But I got like three or four hundred Replies and I asked people how much money they have in their checking account how much they have in their bank account How much they pay themselves how much do they have in illiquid assets? I got a hundred and then what their job title is and where they live and I got hundreds of replies and I published all the data um And I took out any information where you could like learn about someone and people loved sharing anonymous information and they loved reading anonymous information like they loved like It was amazing and so I agree.

I think it's pretty sick and it was way. Oh, there it is. I'll bring you posted it It was way easier to get people's I'm not like literally getting their information because it's all anonymous But people were so forthcoming with us. It was pretty cool and pretty interesting Yeah, I want somebody to do this with vcs. Um, I think most people don't know how much vcs make and all the different people in the food chain like the gps versus like a partner versus like a associate or whatever and um I feel like somebody should like kind of crack that egg open and be like look here's the here's the numbers Here's what it is and anonymize it.

Um, but give people some transparency into what what's really going on Let's talk about this for a second So there's two companies that come to mind that are interesting to me Without when we're talking about this the first is pitch book, you know what pitch book is? Yes So pitch do you pay for it? It's so expensive. No, my sister in law works there though And so every once in a while she'll she'll be kind enough and let me ask her a question of like to look up Uh, no, I don't pay for it because it's really expensive.

It's like 25 000. I think yeah Um, so pitch book. It's kind of like crunch based but souped up and so you pay 25 grand and you get access to like a lot of information about privately held companies Uh, the second well, let's just talk about pitch book. The reason it's interesting is they have a team of outsourced folks I don't know which country they're in but I think the Philippines and they literally have like 200 people and By the way, pitch book is a public traded company. You can go and read about them They're owned by morning stars So you can actually go and see their operations and how they work how they work.

They're growing like crazy They're have north of 100 million in revenue um, you can they have a team of folks and what they do is Call vcs and they literally just ask them information or they call companies and they just ask them information And for some reason I don't know how or why People give them information and that's one of the ways one of many of ways that they get data the second thing is this uh Business called is it called the org? Have you is that what it's called? Yes? Okay, the org very interesting because In a nutshell their tagline is the org transparency starts here build a better organization with a public org chart Celebrate your colleagues basically.

That's just kind of crap. Let's not let's not read their marketing. Yeah, really What it is. I mean, I'm sure they do all that nonsense, but it's a fun. It's an org chart It's a public org chart Yeah, you pay money and you get access to people's org chart and this helps you know who to email to sell shit to right exactly Uh, and that's cool. Like there's no I don't know why they don't just say that but they've raised a lot of money Like I think tens of millions of dollars Is probably going to be a monster business and so I would do two things with the salary thing one.

I would actually hire People in the Philippines or whatever and just Hit it hard and just go out and hit it hard and I would trust that a lot of people would be actually pretty pretty transparent Uh, and the second thing is I would paywall it kind of like the org and I would sell this to every hr Department in the country So I have a friend that is doing this with Shopify sales. I showed him a way to Roughly estimate how much a not roughly it's pretty good estimate how much how many how much sales a Shopify store is doing and What is that? What can I get you don't have to say if it's true? Is it because you order from them and you see what the order number is? That's one of the ways.

Yeah, and that's one of the best ways and so I showed him I said look this is this is useful Um, people want to know what their competitors are doing and and the second way is you look at the traffic Uh, yeah, you you still need a couple other pieces of information. For example, you need to know how much the average order is and things like that but But roughly that that will tell you, you know, how they're doing and so now he emails me a report every month that shows me You know, these four companies that I decided hey, I want to track these four companies and he emails me report This is their sales.

This is their social media following. This is how many ads that they're running on facebook and One other thing which is just like the month over month changes between those and I think it's a great idea So he was kind of looking for something to do. I told him look. I think this is a good pivot I don't know exactly how well he's doing. I should really shout out the name, but I kind of don't remember Let me look it up while we're doing this. But how'd you find this person? He was in my mastermind Uh, let me see what his thing is called.

It's called Okay dramatic pause let me figure it out and you came up with the uh with the I told him I was like look uh, he because he was like dude. I'm good with data. I'm interested in this kind of stuff um, but I also like, you know, and I also have a team of the Philippines and um, You know so so I really like this. Okay, so here it is. So the the website is shop sales data dot com and uh, I hope he gets a bunch more customers from this. I hope he's still doing it He still emails me my report.

I hope he's taking more customers right now But it's a monthly report of Shopify competitor data in your inbox every month for a hundred dollars or something like that Yeah, this is great. I mean you could do the same with um Facebook ad accounts just like because that facebook shows everyone their ads you can say You know email me my competitors ads every time they launch a new one Exactly and so I think that there's like there's some good stuff in this kind of like data Data based businesses where you're just collecting data from public sources.

You're cleaning it up You're structuring it and then you're offering it as a service to a bunch of other, uh companies Okay, you wanted to uh mini one. Do we have a mini one? Oh, yeah, let's do a quick one. What else we got? um Do you have anything good of like your first week working on a real job? It is was my first week and now it's in my second week and I'm sitting on the beach in Hawaii. Uh, so We're doing it Having a job rocks I should have done this years ago. I love having a job Um, it's cool, man HubSpot announced that they had a billion dollars in revenue like uh, Like uh run rate.

It's pretty amazing. And so there's like two things. This is like my first like real job, uh, or like a corporate job Um, I mean that's not exactly true. Like I would have friends Like my friend neville who is like a works for himself He would be like, hey, do you want to go hang out on a Wednesday? Like at noon? I'm like, no dude. I have a job Like right so I treat like running my company. It was 100 more like more than a job. It's two jobs. Yeah It's more than it's I would call it a nine to five.

I'm like, yeah, like I'm it was in fact way more than nine to five But I was like, I'm like pretty straight like I get to work at nine I do my thing like anyway, I try so I tease about this but yeah first like corporate job, um It's It's gonna slow down But like the amount of meetings is pretty crazy and I told them I'm not doing meetings like this anymore. Um, Because I'm gonna make stuff, but I don't know how It's still crazy to me how people find time to get the actual work done Yeah, I uh I realized how that works, which is just that managers don't get work done managers just go to meetings And then I sees or individual contributors is the known Are the ones who actually like sit down and do work because they don't have you know back to back meetings throughout the day But I think even like your work is basically just communicating between people But my seven days of working has shown me that even I see you have a lot of meeting Yeah, like they should they should they should not have that many they should have like whatever one or two or three a day But uh, they should have like, you know Some work in three and five hours of uninterrupted time Yeah, like so is that a like I just don't understand how people so like I'm telling everyone at husband I'm telling everyone at husband.

I'm like, you don't know what talked to me for these hours. I had I like Like and I'm like this is I and I and I say I say it nicely, of course But I say uh, I'm doing this for the better of everyone like I'm gonna make good stuff So like let me go out my hole and you just just don't bother me. All right. What's been the worst part so far? The meetings let's be honest. Okay. What what what meet with the meeting's boring or just the amount of them? The amount and also like I didn't know what workday is and all this stuff There's just so much paperwork that I've always had people do for me that I'm having to do What's the worst part? Uh, you know, like everyone's like is having a boss weird because I've never had a boss before No, I think it's gonna suck after a while.

Of course like having a boss might suck. I'm so pumped I don't have to like I get to just shovel shit onto Kieran's plate that I don't like I'm like, hey, uh You know, we should be hired this person like I don't have to make that decision I love that. I love that. I think it's awesome. Um, so having a boss has not sucked so far Um, I don't know. What do you think would be the worst parts? So I'll tell you if they are what was your worst part? There's certain meeting types that you have to do that I just found like completely soul sucking one of them was called a calibration meeting.

It's basically like Uh, even just describing it, you know gives me some pain here. Basically, it's like You're trying to promote people. But how do you know like if every manager has their own criteria for promotions? How do you make sure you're promoting people equally and fairly throughout the company? So you have to do these things called calibration meetings where you sit down and you basically say This person's up for promotion or they get they're getting promoted because of this this and this and then other person says Well, you know, I I felt like they weren't uh, they weren't great at this So they didn't do a great job with that project and you have to kind of defend them for me It was boring on two levels one One first and foremost, I didn't know anyone else in the company So I just sat there for three hours not being able to say anything because I didn't interact with any of these people I just got here.

I just got bought. I don't know these people. I can't give any input Nor do I have any opinion on if the if the feedback is valid or not and the second thing I was just like wow Even after all this talk like I still just feel like the person who's the most uh vocal and best salesperson Um is getting their way and the person who's not that great at talking is not getting their way So like we could have just skipped all this like it would have almost been better Had we not gotten into this room and said you sell your person and you sell your person and you Debate this person's like the better debater wins in big companies and I think that that's like really crazy well a thing we do at our company all the time which is like if We'll say I'll like if a skid meeting starts for 30 minutes and and like in the meeting I'm like okay.

I said what I had to say. I don't need to be here anymore. I'm leaving or like it's very it wasn't considered Rude to be like hey, uh, you need to leave now. You're done Uh, it was like kind of a helpful thing and I'm still trying to figure out how to politely do that here I'm like Do you guys need me here? Can I can I leave right or or I'll just say I'm out Yeah, I've said what I need to say it. I've heard what I need to heard you guys can talk um Especially on zoom or whatever you just sort of like Hold up you wave And you click exit the second thing is hubspot is doing really well um And just the software business and this sounds like just like like obvious stuff from anyone who's in software But I've never been at a company like this Man, if you figure out how to get a if you figure out how to reduce your churn to to very little or or even positive So for every dollar someone spends it's above one dollar the next year.

Um, and you pick a big enough market It's just magical like just now. I understand why people are saying like, oh, you know, why is this company valued so high highly? It's like well because sticky revenue software revenue. So something like I don't know if hubspot would be considered this but something for sure where you're building an entire business off of You know that the switching costs are quite high. Um, it's pretty amazing like Software like just start a software company. It's so much better than everything else Like it's really hard and it's slog early on but if it really truly if you can get your churn to be right and you pick a big Enough market It's just um if and you have a and you can figure out how to have a good marking machine which all this is like Oh, yeah, if only you could do that like I know but like you you can kind of figure it out actually I think given enough if you if you give yourself like five years to figure it out I think you can um, well, I think All the things you're saying are true and they really just point to this one less And I've learned the hard way over and over again, which is it's much more important to pick what game you play than to try to be the best player at a game Because if you pick the wrong game even becoming the best player still ends up in a small outcome or a really painful path but if you pick the right game to play And whether you become the best or not even the best but you know, just kind of the top 25 percent um It's just so much better to win that way and in this case like we've if we've we talk about and we've done different types of Businesses, right? We've done Like I did social network.

I try to make a new social network. It's the wrong fucking game to play dude. It's so hard So hard so it's a low chance of probability of success. You did a media business also hard hard, you know Higher odds of success but like lower size of the prize if you get it right way lower size Um, ecom, you know, just a fucking pain in the ass just tons of headaches all the time with your supply chain and logistics Because you got real world products and you have to like ship them all around the world and you're gonna have customers and have returns and like Things that just like are not as easy as software.

And so like we've and you know We talk about all these different, you know Doing a paid newsletter or whatever like there's all these different models And for my money by far the best one is to build a software business Because a software business can scale a software business can like Be improved over time and you know unlike ecommerce when you when you make a crappy ecommerce product Uh, you know, you go make a better version the next You know, it takes you six months to make it and then you make it and all those old customers You've got the bad products still think you suck Whereas with software you push the update and all of a sudden every single customer has the new best thing you know, there's all these just tiny advantages and um software is the way to go but we I want to say something that david seagull.

So we had david seagull on last time he had a uh A billion dollar or close to billion dollar t business and I go david. Why are you doing? Freaking motor stores when you could be doing software and he said the right thing What did he say? It was like, oh, it's fun. I love selling product and I was like That's the best answer That is a wonderful answer and I think that like will I ever be able to start an enterprise software company? I think that if I was going to udi either have to be very soon or even a few years ago like you You have to do it.

I think when you're like really like where money is the one number one thing It's like I got to get paid. I got to get my hit and um in that case. Yeah, I would do anything to make money but Where I am now and what I think where a lot of people are is you really it's it's I agree with everything you said but you have to add the and also Not like passionate about but what what what excites you enough to that you're willing to get good at it over a decade Right. We'll let you boat.

All right. So let's take you okay You're happy at HubSpot. Everything's great. You're gonna be there for for 20 years. We know that Alternate reality, you know, we all know you're happy at HubSpot. You'll be there for two decades. It's great It's you know, sunshine and rainbows. Let's say alternate reality. They fire you tomorrow. You're gonna go build something else Where do you think you would go build would you do what you're would you go media? Would you go something totally different? Would you go software? What do you think you would do? Everyone's gonna laugh at me because I say trucking but I would do something maybe something Something in the agriculture space.

Yeah, I think ag tech is is ag tech is interesting Uh, I think that's the most interesting. I had a great call with this guy who I'm gonna. We gotta have this guy in the podcast his name's Uh, just his son's name is Jordan. I can't remember. Uh, Rob Uh, van trump. It's called the van trump report. So van trump report. It's this guy who has a newsletter that does 20 million dollars a year In subscription revenue. He's the only writer And he was telling me all about ag tech. Do you know what ag tech stands for? Yeah agricultural tech And he was just saying all types of like what's going on and I think working with like middle america people who Whether they're rich or not, they're more humble and they create things that actually impact the world like get food to you I would do something in that space or I would start another media company But okay, let's say you go into ag tech All right, and you're you're probably gonna be open and whatever, you know, you'll think of it then but knowing what you know now Would you do media in agriculture? Would you do? Uh, you know something with actual farms and logistics.

Would you do technology hard? You know trucking the actual self driving trucks. Would you do a job thing? Would you what would you what model would you be wanting to do in that space? Well, okay, so I don't like this question because it could it'll change every single day you ask me But as of right now, I would start a blog With in the ad tech space and then eventually I would turn it into a database kind of I like this this company to org I think I could create something like a database that's better Um, and uh, yeah, that's what I would do.

Okay. So I think that's what I would do as of right now that that fascinates me or I would create um Do you know what tiger 21 is? Isn't that like a like a kind of a club conference or club or mastermind thing or something like a club for people who have Investable assets north of ten million dollars and it costs 30 grand a year it's and they have like uh thousand people who are subscribed and uh my friend joined and I looked at the back end and it was Horrible and I was like, oh, I'm just gonna clone that.

And what do they do with the with the members? Is it events or is it uh? it's like Both but like they create like um Like little like safe communities where like you meet in groups of ten and you kind of show off your portfolio and people criticize you and like Try to make you defend your position so you get better But it's it got bought by private equity so it makes a lot of money. All right. That's cool
