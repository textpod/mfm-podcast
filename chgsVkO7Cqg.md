# Why You Should Side Hustle As A TikTok Realtor, Conan Oâ€™Brien Gets Acquired For $150M & More

Date: 05/26/2022

Duration: 1 hours, 6 minutes, 47 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

So somebody had tweeted out something which was like, hey, if you needed a side hustle that was gonna generate like 3K to 5K a month, and you could only kind of work like, you know, let's say like, you know, a couple hours and during the week and a half a day on the weekends or something like that, what would you do to do that if you didn't know how to code? Are we good? I'm a whole different guy, Sam Parr. I'm, you're looking at a man four days in to clean eating. And guess what? Now I'm on time.

Guess what? Now my kids love me. Guess what? The stocks went up today for the first time into like five months. So a lot of things are going well here. What are you eating? I'm just like, I don't know if this is healthy or not, but I'm very heavy meat and protein right now and just like nothing bad and not eating late, not doing bad stuff. Dude, listen to this thing that I'm doing. It's called My Body Tudor. Have you heard of it? I have heard of this. Is it like a text messaging thing? Somebody like...

It's way more primitive than that. So basically I pay them either six or $700 a month. I don't remember if it's $5.99 or $6.99. And this woman named Heather, she's like my coach, she just calls me every single morning and I have to tell her what I ate, what I'm going to eat today. And then she tell, and then I write down on my fitness pal what I've eaten the day before and she'll say, yesterday was bad or good. Here's why. Tell me what you're going to eat today. That's all it is. It's a five minute phone call.

And it's amazing. It's, you should try this. It's actually quite good. I should try this. The fact that I don't want to try this tells me that I absolutely should try this. So I think I might. I think I might do it because, yeah, I don't know. It's, I'm, I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what's embarrassing. What's embarrassing was that a day and a half into just eating clean is just not, not like, you know, oh, my daughter's leftover macaroni and cheese. All right, let me just eat these three spoons before I put it in the sink or like, oh, there's a free cookie here at this thing.

Let me just grab that. A day and a half in, I felt a difference, which tells me how poorly I had been eating if I could feel a difference just from a day and a half of eating perfectly right. What do you eat normally that's bad? Like are you talking about like process? Just clean me just like no sugar and not processed. No sugar, not processed. Not like late night snacking or whatever. Like just cutting it off at a certain time. And then not like, okay, you know, I've been, like, you know, what'll happen to me sometimes is I'll be like, oh, I'm working.

I got calls, I got the pot, I got all this stuff going on. I'm excited. I look up, it's 2pm. I haven't eaten anything. And I'm like, all right, the next edible item in sight is just getting like devoured. Right? It's like a stress eat at that point. Yeah, it's getting got. Oh, you thought there's party size of Doritos was for a party? No, it's getting got right now. And so, you ever heard of, you ever heard of someone doing a line of Oreos? It's when you get the Oreo tray and it's got like three columns and you do a whole line.

You just take a whole column out in one sitting. That's something that would happen before, you know, just on an inconsistent basis. I'm down man, I like to do Oreo cereal. You just get a gallon of milk and a sleeve of Oreos and just go to town. So I'm a boy with you, man. I like all that stuff too, but you just can't do it. Yeah, I can't do it. All right, so we got a bunch of stuff. Let's do some of these topics. I don't know where you want to start. Oh, actually, I just see my topics.

I don't see yours. Do you have any? I had a few. We went through a lot of them the other day, but well, one thing that is quick. The classic we went through a lot of them the other day. The classic. No, I'm usually really prepared. But do you see that Conan O. Brine's thing got acquired Team Coco? Yeah, you texted this. So he has a podcast network or is just his one podcast? It's a podcast network, but I think he's the heavy hitter. And it's sold for like $160 million or something, you said, right? $150 to $200.

I forget the number, but they have $16 million downloads a month. We have two or three million a month. Oh, MFM sized. We have two or three million a month. So what does that put us worth? And ours is a business. Like it's the people listening, you guys are richer than like Conan O. Brine's audience. Yeah. And we're way better looking and way more funny. So, you know, if you just take his multiple and you say, all right, divide by eight, we don't do public math. So that's unfortunately just the problem. We're not going to know how much worth because we go into public math and moving on to the next topic.

I think it's $20 million. Who bought it, by the way? Serious. Serious bought it. Okay. So he's going to like go exclusively to them. Yeah, but honestly, I'm going to call our shot a little bit. I don't think that it's going to be that crazy that in a year or two, we get paid like 10 or 20 million a year to license out to Spotify or something like that. I would enjoy that. That sounds a little crazy. 10 or 20 million, I think sounds a little crazy. But then again, like it sounded crazy that, you know, like for example, the ringer when they got bought by Spotify, so they were a sports network of podcasts led by Bill Simmons.

Bill Simmons was sort of like the Conan O Briand of that network. And they got bought, I think, for $200 million. And what's crazy is it's not even exclusive to Spotify, which is just like wild to me that that's how favorable these deals are in the same way that Joe Rogan, when he got paid by Spotify, he had to take it off of YouTube. But he's still on the he's still on Apple Podcast, which is pretty crazy. So when the ringer sold to Spotify, $200 million, I think they were doing about 15 million in revenue when they got bought for $200 million.

Crazy. That is absolutely crazy. And was it only one podcast? Or no, they actually had a bunch. It was like 12 maybe or something like that. But they've got a few winners. It's like three winners. And then like, it's like one big winner, two small winners and a bunch of like long tail stuff that kind of doesn't matter in terms of like how big it is. But also, I think for them, you know, the thing is, it's not like they were bought for a revenue multiple. It's not like Spotify was like, you know what, we're going to buy this revenue multiple because you know, that's going to get priced at a, you know, a favorable rate in the market here.

It was just like, we need to strategically move into podcasting. Okay, go get Rogan, go get the ringer, go get the one that got bought that like a bar alley is that startup one, Gimlet. So they bought Gimlet also for a lot of money. They bought anchor that podcasting tool that sucked. Like not sucked the tools cool, but nobody was using it. They bought that thing for like 150 million, which is crazy to me. And so they, they, they splurged. And I think, you know, that splurge, that splurge window is now closed. Well, listen, if you're a listener and if you work at serious or Spotify or something like this and you want to throw a few...

We are motivated by money. Yeah. We do things because people pay me money. So we can have that conversation. I enjoy commas with many zeros around them. Yeah. Down. So anyway, if you're listening and you want to make an introduction or you want to help us get paid. Can we talk about this? Okay. So I have a few ideas. So I have a couple of things I want to talk to you about later. I want to talk to you about this new version of plastic surgery that I think is interesting. I want to talk to you about virtual reality project that I saw that was actually doing it's pretty significant revenue.

I want to talk to you about this like bionic reading thing. So I have a few things I want to talk about. But first, can we talk about this meme, the drink and a cola meme? Yeah. Yeah. So Sam texts me while we're on vacation. And I was like, dude, this is perfect for the pod because you saw a tweet from Moise who came on the podcast the same day or the next day or something like that. And Moise said something like, I don't know, can you pull it up with the exact phrasing is? But he was just tweeting about some business thing.

He's like, oh yeah, I was drinking a cola with the founders of this blah, blah, blah app. And then he said some business thing. And Sam rightfully pointed out how hilarious that intro is of like, I was enjoying a cola with my friends. And then we decided to start talking about cash flow. I met with the triple whale founders yesterday for a cola. They were exhausted from a day of traveling. But we all left with so much energy. Genghis Khan conquered 30% of the world during his reign. We want to do the same except the world is now a digital marketing share.

But the intro was, I met with these founders yesterday for a cola. That tweet is hilarious on multiple levels. First of all, the benefit of these founders for a cola. Hilarious who drinks cola? I don't know. Who says cola? Who calls it cola? First of all, that's like who smokes and drinks soda still. I don't know. Second, who calls it cola? Third, why is that relevant for the tweet? It's so funny. We have to do a series of tweets where it's like we talk about something profound, but the intro is like, you know, so I was getting some caramel with a friend or.

Yeah. Yeah. So like it just got to be like the most random stuff. Snapping off a beef jerky with my buddy, Timmy. And he told me about how self storage market is really going under right now. It's like. Yeah. Who says a cola? Do you think that's what he meant is a cult like he sat down for like Pepsi? Like. It's like, you know, at a board meeting today, we poured out a peppermint schnapps and decided to. Yeah. Like. Yeah. That is weird. So that's my new like if we ever do an event or a conference, it's like that's the passcode.

Like how do we know you're real and you're a real listener? You're real loyal is like you need to be able to come up and tell us a story. Tell us a story that starts with like, you know, so I was eating a Dunkeroo and just had a question. Or we got to like do the most extreme thing ever where it's like, so I was doing this thing where you suck on a piece of candy and then spit it in your friend's mouth to the change the taste. Anyway, we're talking about that's important, but we were talking about the economics.

Yeah. No, it's so good. It's so good. That's my new shit. You know, my last shit was I have moved straight to the end because of Elon and I haven't moved straight to the end. That's done. And my new shit is my buddy, we're doing the spaghetti thing where we each take one into the noodle and suck on it. But when we got close to the noodle, we realized the problem with COVID. Then we started talking about the recession. And I was looking. Yeah. That's pretty good. Drinking a cola. All right. Wait, really quick. Do you think that he was trying to be funny? No, that's the best part.

I think he was just saying like, I think he was just saying what happened and that in his mind is what happened. Even the second part of the tweet alone, I read it, take the cola part out. Just being like, I met with the founders of Triple Whale and if you bring Genghis Khan into whatever sentence you're saying, you are dramatically overestimating whatever you're doing in life. It's like the same way where if anyone's like, yeah. You know the way that Tesla came out with the Roadster first. So we're also doing like a high end of digital marketing attribution before we go low end.

It's like, no, you're making yourself equivalent to Tesla. And like that's anytime you're like Genghis Khan conquered 30% of the earth, whatever the next sentence is, better be fucking lit. And instead, his was like, we're doing the same for digital marketing. And so that also was like, you know, just hilarious to me. Is cola, was Mois born in America? Yeah, he's born here. I think they were born in Pakistan and then they moved when they were like seven or five or something. Is that like a Pakistani thing where they call like soda cola? I don't know, maybe because actually I have a cousin who came over from India about like when he was like 20 and he would always be like, hey, can I have a Coca Cola light? And we're like, what? I wouldn't just say it.

He would always say the full name of things. And it was like, OK, yeah, like, is this covered by nationwide insurance? It's like, yeah, it is. Funny you ask. This is awesome. We could go on this forever. Yeah, it's too much for me. All right, so I want to talk about a couple ideas. Did you see this thing about I have this link in here? You can see it's this the surgery that guys are getting that cost seventy five thousand dollars, but it'll make you three inches taller. Do you see this thing? They break your right.

That's a great thing to text to like your friend who like is a little short. You're like, hey, good news. Good news. Congrats. Congrats. I heard about the break the scientific breakthrough. Oh, what happened? You're going to vex me? No, they break your femur and they'll put a rod in and it'll make you three to five inches taller. And this thing is like apparently just popping off. And I've just been looking at this like, it's like, what are the big problems that nobody wants to admit to but are real? I just think that that's an interesting prompt for business ideas.

So it's like. Our buddy Craig Clemens does this where like one of his products is like one of his best selling products, right? Like he's got these DTC companies that do like, I don't know, over a hundred million a year in sales as part of his like bootstrapped thing. And I think one of their products was like some toenail fungus remover. And it's like just like the unsexiest thing, but it's like common. And it's actually somebody, something that people really want to get rid of, right? Or they were something that people really want to change.

And I think height is another one. I've seen this now in two places. So first I saw this surgery thing and I was like, oh, that's funny. Like the article was written almost like, can you believe this crazy thing people are doing? And in my mind, I was like, yeah, I can totally believe that. I think being three to five inches taller is fucking awesome. Yeah, exactly. Like if you're gonna be a Breston plan, you're gonna be a Breston plan or like a fake ass. Like, yeah, this is, this is I'm on board. Exactly. And I was like, you know, being taller is like, you know, just awesome.

Like if you gave me three inches, I'd be very happy. I'd earn more money and I'd be more liked. Like that's just a thing. Like Ben, how tall are you? Like six four, right? Yeah. Yeah. So you already know, you already know the advantage. You're so privileged, dude. You shouldn't even talk to the podcast. You're so privileged. You're speaking from tall privilege right now. Check your privilege. Yeah, you need to check your tall privilege at the door right now. I had a girlfriend one time. Not like a girlfriend, but like a girl I was familiar with who said, who told me, I can't tell if I think you're actually handsome or if you're just tall.

Yeah. By the way, Sam, in your course, there's a review from me saying like Sam's copyrighting course, it works. I got three extra inches in two weeks or something like that. And did you write that because people keep coming to me? That's so funny. Yeah, they're like, dude, that's so funny. And it's either I blacked out or someone is just impersonating me because I don't remember writing that. But it's hilarious. Basically, if you go to trycopythat.com and you scroll all the way down like on the sales page, you'll see like a and it says Sean Perry, the and then the review is loved it so much.

It gave me three extra inches, totally five out of five stars. I thought you did that, which was funny. But the fact that someone else did it and wrote your your name is funny. Your yeah. Exactly. Dude, I knew a guy. Yeah. So this is an interesting question. We I know a guy named Nat and he's got an app. It's called like I forget what exactly what it's called, but it helps you with a kegel. You know what a kegel is? I I think I think a kegel is the exercise that you do. Or is it the muscle that needs to be stronger? It's the exercise.

It's the exercise that you have to do that keeps you from prejacking early. I guess that's a more or I like how you just shortened it. You're like if I just say half the word, it's half as bad. The other thing I think I think women do it, which is like supposed to be just like good for you in general, but also like for women, it kind of tightens. It helps them feel helps helps sex feel better for them. I think it's the idea. Well, this guy and he created an app for men to keep you from just jacking early.

And I think he kills it. Let me guess. It's not like it's doing pretty well. Like take it a month. Yeah. I guess let me guess. It's doing pretty well. Yeah. It's doing good. And so that's like another one. I don't know if that's that big of a market, but what else is there? I think it is a huge market. I mean, look at what Ro and Hems did, right? So they took erectile dysfunction. And they wrapped a brand that you won't feel embarrassed you're, you know, like associated with around it, right? Like the value of Hems is is partially the telemedicine piece, which is like, you don't have to go to a doctor and talk to somebody face to face about this.

So it's like reduces shame on one end. And on the other end, it reduces shame the other way, which is you get the package. There's no label on it. It's like completely discreet. And secondly, like they made their brand cooler so that you don't feel like a schmuck for you. You don't feel like something's wrong with you or you're broken in some way for using them, right? Like that's like the value of their brand. And that's why they built literally a billion dollar brand doing that. Yeah. Here's another one. Have you ever, have you ever like cheese grated your foot to get the calla sauce? You don't cut it like that's the most country thing you've ever said.

No, I have never done that. Like, you know, like with parm, have you ever like. Oh, I know what you're talking about. Like, I've seen, I've seen a girl doing this on the, like there's like a, like they're equivalent of like a sweet potato peeler or whatever. And they just like use that on their like to get their callus off their foot. Yeah. So I just sent it to you in the chat box. It's basically, I bought one the other day because I had just like calluses on my foot. And it's basically just a cheese grater, like a, like a for parmesan cheese.

They just call it a foot. They call it colossal foot rest. A foot file is what they call it. It's got almost a hundred thousand reviews. Oh my God. This thing is 82,000 reviews on Amazon. It's just a cheese grater that they just call it. Have you ever seen a product with more reviews than that? Like the whole pot has an Instapot or whatever. It has that many reviews. Is that crazy? It's a $10 like made in China cheese grater. Wow. They just call a foot file. Is that a thing? It's insane. That probably cost them 50 cents, right? No, more than that.

But like, yeah, it's still profitable. That's crazy. Cause they're just going to get somebody searches, right? Like for something like this, the other one that's like the height one that I saw. So somebody's doing this on TikTok and the ad is brilliant. So they're selling a shoe, like a men's platform shoe. So it's an insert into a normal shoe. That's kind of like a heel. But instead of the heel being on the outside of the shoe, it's on the inside. So your foot just like your heel gets elevated from the inside like a Dr. Scholl's, but like gives you two and a half inches and inside of a shoe.

I don't think there's surgery. Just do that. Way better, right? And so how do they sell this? How do they sell this? The TikTok ad is it looks like, so it's, you know, this like, I don't know if you've heard this thing in comedy, like a man on the street interview where it's basically like, if you ever watch those late night shows, they'll go to like Time Square. They'll be like, you know, do you support, you know, whatever this thing? And then people don't even know what it is. They like say stupid stuff. But it's basically like dude walking around with a microphone out and about like Time Square outside of a nightclub or like at a bar and they just like ask questions.

And so the ad is a TikTok is on TikTok. And what the guy's doing is, are the girl is another guy's interviewing girls. He's like, all right, be honest, the size matter when it comes to height for guys, right? Or like something like that. They like immediately get you of like, okay, first, this doesn't look like an ad. Secondly, you kind of want to know what the girl says. Because every man is so conscious of it. Exactly. Because it's preying on an insecurity. And so then, and it just quickly cuts between the girls and they'll be like, and it ranges from a girl being like, like, no, okay, yeah.

And then like, you know, so it's kind of like her admitting it. And then it's like the next one is like two girls that be like, hell, yeah, she won't even date a guy if he's not six, five. And she's like, no, no, she's like, no, tell the truth. It's true. And like, and it's kind of like preying on the guys in security like, oh, man, girls really care about this. They won't admit it. But if you get them to be honest, they really do care that that extra height matters. It'd be like, what's the perfect height for a guy? And then they'll be like, um, six, one.

And like, you know, the average guy is my five, nine. And they're like, yeah. And then they're just laughing, right? And it's like four of those cuts of like that interview. And then it's like, um, and then they do an even better version of it. They're like, I've seen one, I think that's like the guys wearing it. And they're like, did you know that he's wearing this thing right now? And they're like, no, I had no idea. And it's basically like, people can't tell that you're wearing these things. And so they're addressing the objections that somebody would have.

So first they create the demand, which is that like girls will find you more attractive if you're taller. Then they address the objections, which is you don't look goofy for wearing stilts. And like, and so they're like, oh, I have no idea. No, you can't tell. Oh my God, that's awesome. Like that's so clever. And so they're like, and they supercut that together. And I saw that and I was like, man, this is a really effective like marketing campaign. And it's also an interesting product category that I wouldn't have rather otherwise really thought about. That's actually interesting.

Yeah. This is pretty cool. I never, that is a good one that people are embarrassed about. They need to do an ad about how like everyone who says they're five, eleven is really just five nine because no one's actually five eleven. Like you just. Yeah. If you did a man on the street, you're like, how tall are you? They're like, yeah, five, five, eleven. I'm six. I'm six. And they're like, OK, cool. We have a thing right here. Just stand up and they're like five, ten. No, it's five eleven. Are you six or. Yeah. Never, never met a six footer in your life.

It's like a leap. Six footer in my life, dog. You five ten. Just admit it. Five ten, six, one, none in between. God, skip that. We went from five, eleven to six, one, but you wait six, even. God doesn't make mistakes, but he never made a man six foot even. That stamp was it made. So like anybody says they're six even, that ain't true. That's why I'm always say at least six one. I'm going to tell you another tick tock marketing thing that I think is pretty clever that I saw. Have you ever heard of? It's probably probably not.

It's pretty pretty niche. But this thing called Farcate Apartments. I have it on here. It's F.A.R. K.A.T. K.T.E. So basically there's a woman on on tick tock and she's a real estate broker or a leasing broker. And I'll tell you how I arrived at this. So somebody had tweeted out something which was like, hey, if you needed a side hustle that was going to generate like three K to five K a month. And you could only kind of work like, you know, let's say, like, you know, a couple hours and during the week and a half a day on the weekends or something like that.

What would you do to do that if you didn't know how to code? And one of the interesting answers was, oh, I'd be a leasing agent because if you can get an apartment leased up, you get, I think the first month's rent or something like that as the broker. And so the rent is going to be, you know, in New York or San Francisco, these big cities rents going to be like three grand, four grand, five grand, six grand. And so if you just lease one apartment, right? So if you get one apartment leased, you know, that's five K right there, that's pure profit, essentially.

And what I saw was that some people, what they're doing is they're creating popular tick tock accounts, just showing unique spaces or like in this case, she shows like hilariously, I think hilariously bad apartments. Like she'll walk into this place. She'd be like, all right, this, this apartment, this condo is a exclusive apartment. It is exquisite in like whatever, you know, Queens here. And then she'll be like, you know, how many bedrooms is it? There's no bedrooms. There's just this loft. Actually, it's not a loft. Actually, it's just this like area above the kitchen where there's like a pipe above your head.

But like there's like three inches to go sleep up there if you can climb up and like, oh, you know, do you like the soothing sounds of water? Well, the toilet keeps running. So you'll have that Zen vibe. And so she's like kind of making fun of like how overpriced apartments in New York are and for like how little you get for how much you pay, which is just a great viral hook, right? So instead of just doing the literal thing, which is go to find an apartment, be like, hey, guys, here's a great apartment.

She finds hilariously bad deals, makes that her TikTok or really good deals. And then she basically says, if you want an apartment, come to me. And so I don't know if this is exactly her model, but because I just looked at it real quick. But like, I think that would be a model that would work is create content like we've seen this on Instagram. There's an account called Zillow gone wild, which is hilarious to watch, which is like, it's just like crazy ass homes from Zillow. And so you can kind of make like house porn or like apartment porn where it's like just really interesting stuff, like really interesting apartments or really interesting homes, really overpriced, really underpriced, whatever.

And then use that as your lead gen for like, by the way, do you actually just want a two bedroom apartment? Like come through, like get it through me. Like here's my listings. Like you can actually say if you want like something that's not like overpriced, here's my listings. And like, I think just doing something like that, you could have have a lot of fun and build a pretty like solid business. I mean, I'm sure she's doing way more than five K a month, but I just thought that was an interesting little model. I looked up, I looked up this word.

I've never heard of that word. It's a I looked it up. It's a it's a Yiddish word that means poor quality. And so who's this lady? What's her handle? It's just that it's that word. Those were she got for our day apartments and that's her TikTok. She has 37000 followers and like, you know, like here's a huge loft in Brunswick and have 108000 views on that video. Right. So she's showing these things, but then she has her actual. So she's like comedy actress slash realtor. If you want my real rentals, you know, compass.com, go, go get them.

And right. Like you know, crushes, crushes. Yeah. So I thought this was great. And it's like completely differentiated from what most people do. And so like I'm trying this right now with the Milk Road, which is like, I'm really obsessed with this idea of like, you if you combine two things that are usually not combined, you don't have to be great at either one of the things because you've created a whole new combination. Right. Like this happens in food all the time. Or like you've you've talked about this formula in food like jumbo donut. It's like, you don't need to have the best donuts, just do a huge donut.

And then people will come to you for that. Right. Go for the biggest make a green, you know, purple catch up green. Like, you know, there's Dorito tacos, right? Like it's not that it's better. It's just so different. And so with Milk Road, we're doing this right now where I'm trying to create like basically a it's not funny enough or it just be like a straight up like comedy thing. I don't like the forecast. A lot of. Yeah, it's like this pie. Yeah, I don't know why I'm trying to go for this like far fetched example.

This podcast, are we the richest? No. Are we the smartest? No. Are we the best prepared? No. Do we have the best insights and research? Absolutely not. Are we the funniest? No. But do we have the right combination of like we were having a good time? We make ourselves laugh and make you laugh just enough where like it's business and it's just enough business and just enough make you laugh. And that's what I'm trying that with the Milk Road now. I'm trying to do the same thing. It's like there's crypto information. There's a lot of people trying to be the smartest guy in the room with crypto.

It's like a big brains contest. You go into a room and everybody's trying to have this like 9000 IQ. It's like, well, we want to be smart, but we're not going to be the smartest because who the fuck knows who's the smartest and it's really hard. But like we can also be slightly funny and we would differentiate ourselves from everybody else doing crypto content. And so I'm pretty interested in this like this like idea of stacking unique skills that are like you don't have to be the best at either. You just have to be just dangerous enough at both.

But if you combine them, you're completely differentiated in your market. Can I ask you about a crypto story really quick that you you might know about? And I need you to explain it to me. So do you know anything about Sam Bankman Fried? This is Dane, right? Bankman. Of course. So how old is he? Is he under 30 still? He's like 29, 30, 31. I know I know he was under 30 at once. But is he still I should know they are currently the leading sponsor of the Milk Road. So FTX, go get your go get your account.

So he is 30 years old exactly on the dot on the dot. All right. That was a bad joke I made, by the way. I said, I knew he was under 30 once, but is he still under 30? I was good. I just didn't pick it up. All right. So this like basically when he was 28, he was worth like 20 billion dollars. Right. Yeah, he's the I think he's probably I think him or the guy from Binance. They're the richest person from crypto, besides whoever Satoshi is. That's crazy. So in this. He said in an article the other day, he's like, I'm thinking about spending a hundred million dollars on the upcoming presidential election, but I'll probably cap out at about a billion.

Yeah. And just like that statement is just a ridiculous statement to like not that it's wrong. They're just like a crazy chain of words added together in one sentence. Like I didn't think I would hear someone say it, let alone a 30 year old. How what type of person is this guy to become that rich at like 28? He he also has a unique skill stack, which is that so he was like, I think a trader or an analyst at Jane Street. So it's like kind of like a smart quant type guy. And then, you know, I think I've told the story before, you know, the story about the the kimchi arbitrage or whatever, you know, this not exactly.

I know that like he did some arbitrage, but I don't understand why Bitcoin to be cheaper in Korea than it would in America. Well, it's all about like kind of like access and the liquidity of the market. So like some markets, like for example, Japan is where the access was the hardest. So like I think let's say this, for example, the government's cracked down on exchanges. So you can only get it in the black market or on these small niche exchanges, these foreign offshore exchanges, there's a lot of friction. And so because of that, you can't access Coinbase.com.

Yeah, like at a given time in Japan, you couldn't access, you couldn't easily buy Bitcoin because of that. To buy Bitcoin in Japan, you were paying a premium. So in theory, you could let's say, Bitcoin is priced at 30 grand. You could buy Bitcoin for 30 grand in America. And if you had a way to sell it in Japan, you could sell it for 32,000. And you could just infinitely make a $2,000 spread. And so it's kind of like, great, how much capital you got, pour it all into Bitcoin in the US and then sell it all instantly in Japan.

And you're not really taking much risk because you're just quickly flipping it for that premium. And so a lot of people were trying to do this. I think there was a spread of about five grand in Japan or something like that at the time. But nobody knew how like it wasn't easy to go sell the thing in Japan. Again, if it was that easy, there wouldn't have been the premium in the first place. What he found was that I think it was in Korea. That he there was a smaller premium, but it was easier to get around.

And so like what what they did was they like literally flew to Korea or whatever. And they like talk to like local banks and they were like, hey, we would like to have an account that will allow us to wire money in significant amount of money. You know, wire money in significant size every day in and out. Like, can you support that? Can you support that action? Because I'm going to basically be transferring in like, you know, call it two million dollars in and two million dollars out the same day. And it has to be the same day.

Just calling that action makes it sound cooler. Can you support that action? That's such a better word than. Can you handle that size? That's my new ship to also, by the way, just being like, yeah, we got to be able to do it in size or like, yeah, they're moving in size. I'm just going to say action instead of the word amount. So like asking my wife how much like beef she wants me to buy at the store. How much action you want? How much action you trying to get on these ribs? In terms of oat milk, are we trying to move size? How much action you want? Yeah.

So basically what ended up happening was he had this company like whatever Alameda Research or whatever. But like he saw that the I think it was like the kimchi premium was like the big premium was like if Bitcoin was 10 K in the US is 15 K in Korea. And I think in Japan, there was a smaller one. And so he was he was able to do it in Japan and he made like something like 20 million dollars doing this arbitrage in like one summer. And it took him like flying there, finding a network of local banks that would let him wire serious money in and out and make sure that they could just repeat these transactions on the same day clothes so that they had the money.

They were recycling a small amount of money. So I think it was like take two million dollars and buy Bitcoin. They sell it in Japan. They take the money that they made in Japan. They need to be able to wire it back so that tomorrow they can go buy again 2.2 million of Bitcoin based off of the extra that they made. And then they did the same thing next day, 2.4 million. And they got it up where they they eventually profited like 20 30 million. So then he basically is like, all right, him and his like small team, I guess, like this little crew that was doing this arbitrage.

Did he have money ahead time or was it just like a like a living with roommates? Living with roommates. Even now he lives like he drives like a old beat up Honda or some shit like that. He sleeps like in the office on a giant bean bag. So there's like tons of pictures of him just like passed out on a bean bag in front of his desk. And it's like it's actually like two bean bags like upper body on one feed on the other creates this tiny little. S B F bridge between them and like that's just the way this guy works.

And he's like, you know, he's vegan. He he's a he's like he practices thing called effective altruism. I think is what you call it. And so so that's his thing, which is like his goal is like this philosophy. And the goal is make as much money as you can so that you can give away as much money as you can. Like that's the point of making money is to give it away in the most effective manner possible. And so it's like earned to give is the like name of the is the name of the of the like the the philosophy of what they do.

Is that one of the things he's trying to do is like. Yeah, that's what he says he motivated by. So he's like, you know, he's donated like I think he donated like he's donated 200 million already of his like net worth. And he's and he's you know, this thing about like I'm willing to donate up to a billion dollars, you know, in the next one is to like, you know, another way to make change. And it's not all political. Like it's like, where does the dollar have, you know, the most effect and that sort of thing? Yeah, he did I also read an interview or is it you told me where he was like, I don't even care about Bitcoin.

Like I'm just doing this to make money. Like he said something to the he's not like particularly. Yeah, it's bullshit. Yeah, so there's a lot of people crypto that are like very missionary. Like if you listen to Brian Armstrong from Coinbase, he's like he like lived in Buenos Aires and he saw like, you know, what happened to the Argentinian peso. And he was like, it's not right. Like people around the world are, you know, don't have access to like economic freedom. And, you know, they live in a place where their currency gets devalued like crazy and like there's a better way and it's crypto.

I believe that to my core and I'm going to like Coinbase is going to help more people like get into crypto because I think crypto is what matters in the world. And Sam Baker Frieds just sort of like, you know, not that his mission is different. His mission is like, I'm an effective altruist. I'm trying to give away as much money as possible so I need to make as much money as possible. And in order to do that, I'm going to just, oh, you know, whether you're selling this or that, like cool, people wanted an effective trading platform for crypto.

I'll build that. You know, I know this product and this need because I'm a trader. So I'll be able to like do it that way. That's baller, man. And there was a meme of him. The other piece of the, I was going to say, the other piece of the effective altruism is like they really use like they wanted to be evidence based that like, you know, every dollar going in is like having like, you know, sort of like the greatest possible impact is like one of their their big things. Like how measurable is the impact? Dude, this guy is great.

There was a funny meme of him going around. Basically, this guy, his name is Sam Baker Fried Google. And he looks like you'd want him to look. So he's kind of like a chubby Jewish guy who wears like new balance shoes and like high socks and cargo shorts and like an army green t shirt and like shaggy hair and a huge time X watch. Like, he looks like a look. Yeah. And he there's a picture of him on stage. And it's like this beautiful interviewer. And then on his left is like Giselle. And on the right is like some other model.

Like how do you clue? I forget. Like these like, you know, smart like business women who are just like the most gorgeous people you've ever seen. And he's sitting in the middle and they're all like looking at him. And it's like, get you get you a person who will look at Sam Baker and Fried like Giselle looks at him or something like that. And it's hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. And he's just kind of hunched over oblivious to the whole thing. It's great. Is he like what makes him special? You know, that's hard to say. I haven't met him.

We've met some of the other like kind of people that FTX team. Like, for example, their head of strategy is like 25 years old or something like that. It might be 24. And he's like the head of strategy there. He like started off in customer service and is now the head of strategy. And so I think they just like if I could just kind of comment on like what you see as the culture for them is like they go hard. What I mean by that is like they're like they're really sharp. They're like kind of like quants.

And then they like work like it just seems like they work very hard. And they move as fast as crypto moves, which is very, very fast. And they didn't like there was no like invisible walls for them. Like the company is based in the Bahamas. They grew like crazy when they wanted to do marketing. They're like, OK, go get Steph Curry and Tom Brady and like, you know, Larry David. And that's who's going to be our spokesperson or whatever. Like they pulled no expenses. They named they like bought arena. Like he called somebody. I know the guy who we met the guy who did the athlete rights for them.

And basically he was like, yeah, he got we got on a call and I was like, OK, so like what are your goals with like, you know, sports sponsorships to help, you know, FTX? How are you going to measure this? He goes, how much does it cost to have the Yankees Stadium renamed to FTX Stadium? It's like, yeah, I don't think that's even like for sale. He's like, OK, what about every ad inside the stadium? And he's like, that's a lot, man. Like maybe we should just like kind of like crawl before we walk in before we run.

And he's like, I think it would be most effective if we go get Tom Brady and Steph Curry and Yankees like you go do that and then tell me when you have them. Like that was essentially the call. And it was like, you know, name your price. And like that's what they did. And guess what? They got all of them. And it's like a pretty impressive strategy where it's like there's not like any, like, you know, tiptoeing around in. I love those people. I call them freaks and I love them. I love these freaks. I love freaks.

What also is one of my favorite Twitter followers. Like, I don't know if you do follow him on Twitter. He posts awesome threads that are like not like, again, it's not propaganda for his company, but it actually is effectively propaganda for the company. So he'll just be like, you know, here's my thoughts on like raising money. Here's what actually happens. And he'll be like, investors, they want us to do this. And at first I thought that's just self serving bullshit. But then I realized actually the game theory is this and then he like just talks.

He'll just lay out these long threads and like, he's like, look, I'm not saying this is FTX's point of view. This is like my late night thoughts about this topic. And when you see him think out loud, you're like, oh, wow, this guy's just incredibly sharp and he sees both sides of it. He's kind of like an independent thinker. And so he's one of the best follows on Twitter. Do you think working with him, do you think that he's he's obviously has some intensity, but is he like a hustle, hustle, like let's work like why? Like, like, this alpha type of guy? No, I don't get that vibe.

I don't get Wolf of Wall Street. I don't get the he's not. Genghis Khan took over 30 percent of the thing. It's like it's more like obsession meets like, you know, we don't know if this got cut. I think it's got cut out of our previous podcast where we were like, we kind of admire. The like Asperger's personality because it has like the ability to like focus really intensely and the ability to like think not like think for yourself and not think just like, oh, what is the norm? What's the side of norms? Like, let me just go with that.

So to me, it's like when he says that let's go get the Yankees and Tom Brady, it's not because like, let's go swing our big D around here and let's go show whose boss. It's like, well, it seems like the most effective thing to do if we're trying to build trust would be go to the most trusted athletes and like get them and on a cost, you know, a cost per, you know, fan basis. They're actually the most effective, even though the total gross dollar bound is higher. Right. Like to me, that's how his brain works.

Not like, you know, it'd be sweet, dude. If we go get like, let's go get the fucking Yankees, bro. Like, it's not that. And so. He just like said, he's like, like, what's at the largest reach? Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, just whatever's number one on that chart, just do that. Right. Exactly. Like, well, if this has the arbitrage, then like, let's put all of our money into it and like, let's hedge it over here. Like that. It's more like that. And so. And so I think that when they, in the same way, like the intensity of the company is high, but I don't think it's because it's like, bro, we got to grind if we want to make it, you know, like, you know, oh, you take weekends off, you know, you're soft, you know, like it's not that.

It's more like, oh, I haven't eaten in 36 hours because I've just been like really interested in this problem. And I'm staring at my screen and I forgot to eat and I forgot to shower. And I also, I guess I'll just sleep on this beanbag because that way I don't need to commute because commuting waste at least, you know, an hour a day. And like, why would I waste an hour of my day? Like, you know, I'm just, I sleep on this beanbag. In fact, it's ergonomic or whatever, you know, like, I think that's more how the brain works where it's like this hyper rationalism is what I would call it.

Do I wonder what he's like as a CEO? Like you think he holds one on one meetings and like, because he just does not look like well, we should have him on him and the whatever they wanted to come on the pod. So I think they're protecting him a little bit. Like he's now super busy with like press obligations or whatever. Like so they, I think they were trying to have like their, the number two guy in the company come on the pod. And so this guy, Brett, so I think he'd be really interesting too.

But you know, everybody wants SPF because he looks like he's the Zuckerberg, right? Like Cheryl might be the secret weapon and the one who actually runs the show. But like, Zuck is this like alien character that people are fascinated with and they want to like poke them and be like, Oh, look, it moves, you know? And so I would love to get Sam on. I wouldn't mind having a guy who is his boss, you know, a guy who works for him. As long as the guy coming on would be cool. We're only going to ask you about Sam.

Is that cool? Oh, you know, I don't think you understand the assignment. We don't care about like you. That's not annoying, right? Yeah. Dude, it's like, if I meet someone who's like, Oh man, love the podcast. I'm like, dude, great. So glad to meet a fan. And he's like, Sam's so awesome. What's it like to be around? Fuck you, dude, I'm busy. Like I'm like a third time. Sam had a couple of guests and they're like, cool. And they like say, like, oh, yeah, I worked with Steve Jobs. And like, wait, wait, wait, all right.

Let's just let's just only focus. Scrap your current thing. So as long as they're OK, like if they understand the assignment, that it's strictly a like, we're just here to like learn. Like Joe Rogan had this guy who worked at SpaceX and they talked about what it's like to work to Elon for Elon. And I was like, oh, just let's just only focus on that thing. They'll go to space. Stuff is cool. But just tell me what it's like to work with Elon. And that's what we as long as they understand that the assignment, I'm on board.

Our software is the worst. Have you heard of HubSpot? See, most CRMs are a cobble together mess, but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous. I think I love our new CRM. Our software is the best HubSpot. Grow better. Here's another kind of like interesting, like intensity team work thing that I think is, you know, close enough transition. Have you seen this business called A Team? A Team? I think it's because I think it's just a letter A and then dot team is their web. Well, you know, that's like a famous TV show, right? You remember Mr.

T. Mr. T or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. All I know is that much. I don't I've never seen anything. So so it's that same. Oh, like I think they're kind of playing on that branding a little bit in the sense that like the idea is based on so they just raised 60 million dollars and they raised it from NFX, who I really respect. NFX was early in them and said good things. I respect that effect. So maybe pay attention. Now, this is an idea that's been around. It's been tried, but maybe the time is right now.

And so that's why this is interesting to me. So let me kind of give you my backstory of this idea. And I want to hear what you think if you think this is a good idea or a bad idea. So I once heard Naval on a podcast talk about like the future of work. Hey, he was basically like, Neval was like, you know, I don't buy this whole. I don't believe that we're going to live in a world where you work nine to five sitting in a desk in some office for one company and you work there for 30 years.

And already you see that shifting like instead of working at a place for 30 years and then getting your pension when you retire and they like, you know, have a cake cutting ceremony in the in the lobby for you as they send you off to your death. Like, OK, now people started to hop jobs more and then people started to work, you know, remote and freelance. And the ball thing was like, he said, I think the future of work is like Ocean's Eleven. He goes, you're going to have your crew the same way that Ocean's Eleven is this bad ass team of like, you know, you've got the pickpocket guy, you've got the ninja, you have the like the comms guy, you have the planner, you have the like, you know, the guy who can go gather intel, you have the hot girl who's the distraction and you have this, you know, you got Brad Pitt, George Clooney.

All right. So that's the team. And it's like, you're just going to get a message which says, all right, guys, round up like we got one, we got a mission to go on and everybody meets up and everything, everything, doing other stuff. And it's like, what's the mission? Oh, like, you know, Ocean's Eleven, so we're going to rob this bank or whatever. And then for for work, it's going to be like, all right, here's this brand that's trying to whatever they're killing the US to try and expand into India. And so you might be the Ocean's Eleven team that continuously gets called on to take a brand and expand them into India.

And like you, you wake up, you get a page, you know, your pager basically goes off. It says, we need you. The bat signal is up. You all congregate. You've all worked together. So, you know, you come as a group who's good at accomplishing certain types of missions. You do those missions, you rate each other, you rate the company that hired you, they rate you, you rate each other on your team, you go on your way and you get called in for the next mission and the money hits your bank. And so, Naval kind of describes this thing and he's like, you won't just have one team.

Like you'll probably float around with a couple teams. Like if you're the pickpocket, you've got like three teams. That can call on you. And it just works that way. So you get reputation that's built not on a resume, but through this like verified ratings of like, I've actually worked with this person. You have not continuous work. You get called on when there's a mission. You'd sprint, you crush it, then you relax until the next mission. You can work as much or as little as you want. You may or may not even know the identities of the other people.

You could be like, my name is, my nickname is just whatever, Star Wing. And I just go in and people know me as Star Wing. And I just, that's how I work. And like, that's the future of work. So that kind of fascinated me when he described it. And he did it in the Naval way, which was like, you know, one tenth of the words I just used, but twice is interesting. And now I'm starting to see some startups pop up that are doing this. And to me, a team is an idea of that where they're like, oh, you want to build an ecommerce website? Well, we have the designer, the front end developer, the back end developer and the like conversion optimizer.

And like, they'll just swoop in and they'll just do it for you in like two weeks. You'll get a better product than whatever. And here's the big lump sum payment you do for that team. This is so amazing. I saw a meme the other day where it was a guy, he goes, I so look forward to the day where I'm just sitting at a bar and a stranger walks up and says, I'm put together a team. And I look at him and respond, I'm in when we leave. And it was just like that. Yeah, I live in the duff bag.

Yeah, I'm put together. I put the team together. You in? Dude, this is awesome. Their site is amazing. This is one of the best landing pages I've seen in a long time. It's a dot team. Look at the landing page. It's pretty good. The hero image is really good. And then, yeah, the examples are good. It just succinctly describe what they're doing. So you just get on, you just log on and you see it. It's a relatively strange concept. And they describe it in like two sentences wonderfully. This is awesome. I'm not sure. I don't I think it's quite bold to say it's the future of work.

I don't think that that's what it is. But I think it's like a subset of freelancing that's going to be amazing. Yeah, exactly. That's not everybody. But in the same way, like the gig economy made it so that, you know, I can like a thing that didn't happen 10 years ago or whatever, like was you wake up, you like hop in your car, you open up your phone, this guy wants a ride over here, drive over there, pick him up, drop him off, cash at your bank. You know, you made $16 for that ride. Oh, you want to go? You want to stop working because you want to go pick up your daughter from school? You swipe to log off.

You're off work now. You want to get back on later, you know, at midnight and take people to the airport. All right, you can do that again. Like that whole gig economy thing where your phone just gives you jobs, what gives you work that will just pay you small micro like payments off your micro tasks. That's pretty cool. And that's like a thing that Uber and like TaskRabbit and DoorDash all brought to the table. So I feel like there might be the next version of that, which is like for highly skilled cross discipline. Like I know I could do this, for example, like I have three or four people where it's like, that's the great developer.

This is the great designer. I'll be the marketing guy and this guy will be the, you know, whatever them. The problem is that they're not available like to do stuff. And this is creating an opportunity for them to be available. But if like I've gone on, I've gone to the Shopify marketplace and I've used Upwork and oftentimes when I use Upwork, it's just like a guy in India who's like the face and he's got like a team of like eight guys and like, and that kind of what's already happening. They just packaged this in a far more sophisticated and sexy way.

Yeah, they did in a more sexy way. And I think it's more for premium like things. So like in the same way that like, if you don't want the India thing, but you want like, sort of like what an agency does, but what typically what agencies do is they specify, they, they specialize in one vertical. So it's like, we do SEO, we do Facebook ads, we do copywriting. And what this is saying is like, no, you're trying to launch a marketplace. You're trying to launch a new NFT marketplace where you're going to need somebody who's great at email marketing.

You're going to need an engineer who knows smart contracts. You're going to need a designer. You're going to need a social media person. So like whatever, they give you the six cross disciplinary people that are good at building marketplaces. And that's just like a different cut of the same idea of agencies. This is awesome. This is one of the cooler companies I think I've seen lately. This is amazing. Yeah. How'd you find this? Because the guys I follow at NFX, they were like, hey, this company's grown really fast. Like fast. I forgot what they said, but it was like growing super fast.

And I was like, how fast? And you know, that's when I started looking to it. And it reminded me of that like, that dreamy idea that Naval had brought up. And I was like, oh, maybe now with COVID, maybe now the time has changed. We're like, there's enough really talented people that are no longer like locked into jobs because they're at home at the Revelle. They've got like all the right people. If you go to like their team, it says that their featured advisors are the guy who started Fiverr, which is crazy. The guy who started Fiverr also started Lemonade.

That's pretty wild. The CEO of Upwork. So like they've got all the right people on board. Wow. Yeah. This is an amazing company. This is a badass find. I've never, I'd never heard of these guys. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. All right. Take another idea off this list and another topic off this list. And let's do that. Let's do that one. Yeah. I literally never read DocuSign. I just signed. This is more like, I just needed to verify with you. Do you also do this? Like, dude, when I get a DocuSign, I'm not reading it. I'm not gonna lie.

You can scan me pretty easily. Have you seen the South Park episode where like it's like what they do is they create, like, you know what a caterpillar is? No. So it's like, Do I want to know? They take a chain of six people and they, I think I know. Go ahead. They sew their mouths to the person's butt and you just gotta stay there. Okay. And Apple does that to people because it says it in the terms and conditions in iTunes when you sign up. And the whole episode is like, whoa, Stan, you didn't read the terms and conditions of Apple before you click.

Yes, that's crazy. Of course, like you have to go do a caterpillar now because that's what it said. I can't believe you didn't read it. And it's like this whole thing. But, dude, I've been getting DocuSigns lately where they literally just send me the sign page and they don't even send me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's people like, hey, here's the DocuSign. It's just a one underline and it says sign here. I'm like, sign what? What am I signing? Yeah. It's called a signature package. And basically I've got in the context of a company that I've invested in.

They need me to sign paperwork for some reason because they're raising a new out of new valuation at a higher valuation. And they literally just send me the signature packet. And like I have it's four or six things. And I'm just, it just says like, Sam Parr, I'm signing and I have no idea what I'm signing. And so yeah, like, A, yes, I do that because I just don't read the stuff and B, sometimes they don't even send me the stuff to read. They just send me, they just signed. I have no idea what it means.

Do you get that? Yeah. I've been getting those and I'm like, I'm like, all right, it's one thing if I'm not going to read it. For you to not even write it, it's like a whole level, another level of arrogance here. And like, you know, poor form that we're taking. Yeah. That's what I'm looking for because I'm like lawyer at fu.com and just sign this shmuck. Just like sign this nerd. I'm sure there's a law firm's name, Fokman Banks. What is that? What the fok? What do those guys do? Yeah. It was based in New York? Yeah.

Why is Seymour Butts asking me to sign this stuff? They're just messing with it. Yeah. That's crazy. It's like, you know, when people really want to get us to respond, they're like Venmo us money or they're like Paypal us money being like, oh, I'm being super creative to like, to reach you, to get you to read my message or whatever. And I'm like, it doesn't really, doesn't really work. I don't really like that. And it makes me feel uncomfortable and like, you know, generally the people I want to meet never do that. So I'm like, you know, generally this is not a good signal for you.

The other day, these guys were emailing me to try their stuff and they're like, what are you soft? You're not up for the challenge. And I just, I was just like, I am not up. I am not up for the challenge. And they just replied with, okay. Is that you are correct? I am not up for the challenge. I think people, they hear us out here and we're joking around and they're like, what if I take that joke to the next level and I make it weird and they don't know me. Somehow think that's going to work.

It's like, this works as me and Sam have known each other for like 10 years and the jokes are meant to be jokes. They're not serious and it's like, then you take the, you take that same idea, you make it serious and you do it from a stranger. It's like, no, no, no, it's not the same thing. Yeah. I actually don't like the annoying. The other day, this guy sent me an email and then the subject line, it said like, you know, like, you're a C word sucker and he's like, made you open. And I was like, oh, I don't, I don't like that, that I find that to be inappropriate and not cool.

Like I'm not on board with that. And that's what he said. But I can totally see how somebody would listen to this podcast and think, ah, they'll love that. Yeah. Like, it's like, why are you approaching me? It's like, we're, that's what we're doing. We're like, oh, I love this copywriting and you know, just do what you got to do. And for the hustle, I was super annoying getting people to be conference speakers like, yeah, but I don't like when it happens to me. Yeah. But I didn't call someone like a little bitch. Like people will call me that.

They're like, what's up you little bitch? Like dude, I don't know you. Who was doing that? Somebody was doing that. Somebody who worked for us was doing that, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have not called them out, but they called us a little bitch and I'm like, dude, you're an intern. Don't talk to me like that. Like my friends don't even call me a little bitch. Like what are you talking about? It was like, I think it was an intern that called us that. Oh, I know. I think it was a Bray you. A Bray you.

You used to call us a little bitch. I wasn't going to call them out. You're like, I'm not going to call them out. Oh, unless it's a Bray you, in which case. It was a Bray you. He was our producer and he'd be like, time to work you little bitch or something. Dude, don't talk to me like that. I'm not talking to you like that. It's like, why are you calling me that? Yeah. Yeah. A Bray you came in really hot. You came in really hot. That's your one. What's this? Yeah. I mean, I love him and he could talk to me that now that we're friends and not coworkers, but when we were coworkers, I was like, dude, I was like offended.

I was like, please don't call me that. That I don't like that. Zelensky deep fake. What's that? Oh, wait. No, what's the history of the year? That's a longer one. I went down this rabbit hole of like the history of the internet, like how it came out. Pretty crazy. Just crazy stuff. I'm not going to do that one right now. That one's too long. Okay. So Zelensky deep fake. So people know about deep fakes, which is like, I think a lot of people who listen probably know about deep fakes, but if you don't, it's basically the way that you can Photoshop a picture to kind of like edit and make it look a certain way.

And it looks real, but like, oh, no, that's been photoshopped. You can now do that with video, which kind of means. It's not easy, right? But that's not a bad thing. It's not yet. There are some, but like, you know, in a small way, like the Snapchat face filter is essentially like a bit of a deep fake. There's this. Have you seen the baby one or the one where it makes you sad and cry? No. Is that on? Yeah. Or it's on Instagram. I think they like show someone's face and they're like, Hey, Sean, why are you so sad? Why are you crying? And you're like, what? I'm not crying at all.

But like, it looks like you're crying and sad. It's like, that's one version of it. Then there's like this. There's this app. I forgot what it's called with some moves or something like that. It's like some dance app, but like, you basically take a picture of yourself standing there and then it'll make it look like your body. The may it'll make you look like a great dancer. You know, you could go post something on Twitter. I think you might have done this where it's like, I think that's what you found it. Because I did it.

It looked like I was breakdancing. Yeah. You're like breakdancing. Yeah. Just jamming out on a Wednesday. It's like, whoa, Sam can break dance. Then it's like, it looks not quite right. Wait a minute. And it's like, oh yeah, that's like a deep fake. Basically, it's a deep fake video. And so this is, but they're getting better and better. Like you'll see them do this with like, oh my God, did you hear Obama saying the N word? It's like, what? No. And then you watch this video. It's like, it's a deep fake, but they could like mimic his voice and his lips moving and talking, doing something.

And then this is happening. It's like, it's becoming a big problem in the porn industry because people are doing this with like, oh, there's some girl in my college and I'll just take her picture and I'll make it look like she shot this, you know, sex tape or whatever. And people like, dude, that's like, you know, really effed up, but like the technology can do that, can do that now. It can basically make it look like somebody was doing something that they never did. And so this is becoming a problem. And there's one with Zelinsky, the Ukrainian president, whatever president, president, whatever he is.

And like, there's this video going around of him talking and it's a real, there's a real video. And then there's the deep faked video where it shows like a trail powder of cocaine on his desk and they're like, and the Russian propaganda is saying, like, look at this, your president's breaking down, he's using drugs. That's why he's saying all this crazy stuff. And they made it, they added some stuff in the background of the video and I'm like, oh man, this is just going to get super crazy of like, how do you know what you can trust? If you can't trust your eyes and ears anymore, like, how are we going to like prosecute crimes? How are we going to like prevent people from like, just completely slandering your reputation? Are we going to prevent people from like, you know, like this was what people said that the Russians were doing with Hillary like during the election was like, they were showing propaganda like Hillary said this about black people and they're promoting that in like predominantly black counties where they were trying to sway the vote and like get them to not turn out for Hillary.

And it's like, it was fake, right? But it was like misinformation. And so to me, I'm like, this deep fake thing is going to be like a real, real problem. And I think there's opportunity. Well, there's one answer that a buddy was trying to work on, which was basically a way to like certify the off like the original mint of the video. So it's like, you can basically encrypt the original video so that if anybody wants to see like, oh, this video of this guy saying this crazy thing, is this was this what was originally shot from the phone? And so he was trying to do that.

But really what you need is you need the phone makers to participate because it has to be done at like the hardware level because any anything else it can be tampered with. It's like, well, if it's just a video file, I encrypt and I could just like encrypt it later. I could edit it first, then encrypt it. So it has to be done like as it's being shot, the apple and Google and Samsung or whoever these people are, they're going to have to bake it in where like every video comes with a seal of authenticity.

And then that's going to be a cat and mouse game of like, can that be faked? Because you could put somebody in prison for like a fake murder, you know, like, that's how crazy this is going to get if we don't have a way to fight against deep fakes. By the way, Gota, you're the chat of Riverside and click the link I just sent you. Tell me what you think about that deep fake. That's you dancing. That's great. Yeah. He said announcement. Well, while you guys have been taking this time to chill, your boys have been learning to dance and get on my level.

And it's a video. Okay. So it's get get get sway. So sway is the name of the app. So get sway dot app is the name of the thing. It's hilarious. Although it made you a little look a little chunky here. You look a little bit like Will Ferrell in this video. So, you know, well, yeah, you could dance, but it also looks like you put on like the COVID 30. I was that was pretty influencer. Well, it's like glitching. It's like it's like it's not the it's not your actual thing. It's like because you're moving so fast, it's like it has to make it fuzzy.

It can't have like a really sharp like line. It's pretty good. It's obvious. For just a good app. I mean, click left, go to the left one. There's another one. I mean, it's pretty amazing for just like a free app. What do you mean? What do you mean? Click left? There's no left. There's a video to your left on the next picture to the left. On your profile? I mean, like it's a pretty amazing. What's the app called? Get sway. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's pretty amazing. Yeah. Anyway, I hope some smart people out there are working on deep fakes.

I'm curious what people are going to do. The only solution I know is doing it at the hardware, the operating system level. And even that's probably not perfect. But if somebody does figure out a perfect way to do this, that's going to be very, very valuable technology. And I saw the Obama thing. Yeah. They made them kind of say some crazy shit. Yeah, man. I agree. It is kind of scary. Well, Ben, what do you think? How do we do? We got to get it early. Great episode. Very eclectic. Very eclectic. But like all very interesting stuff.

And the cola stuff was all time. Yeah. Can't wait to drink a cola with you guys. What was your favorite one? Your favorite non cola, doing the cola one, which one's you like? I think eating caramel is also my favorite. It's just simple and amazing. It's all unexpected. I think my favorite was actually we were just eating spaghetti kissing in the middle when all of a sudden. Me and my co founder were doing the kissing, the spaghetti thing where you each take one and put it in your mouth and get me in the middle. And what we realized was that the recession.

Yeah. And then we realized. Yeah, that's a good one. But the thing is like, but the thing about co founders is it's like you don't address the first part. And you got to do this like in a keynote. That's like a product, like a steep job product announcement. And never address it. And never look at the office grabbing each other's butts and then it hit us. Why stop there? You know. All right, we're out of here. This is great.
