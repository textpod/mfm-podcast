Date: 02/03/2022

Duration: 1 hours, 23 minutes, 44 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

Like you got to choose the business model that's right for you but answer the question of like okay, can this audience that I have Make me a billionaire I have one house that's gonna fall off like 15,000 a month and it's just a single house So you'll be there by quite a bit. No way really. What's what's the house worth? I? Bought it for 900k Where's it yeah It's in in Boise like right next to the Boise State University Stadium So do you get like basically like football tourists or what are you who's renting this thing for $700 a night in Boise? We're live by the way, Nathan.

We're live Great. No for real Who's renting it so you get like all graduation everyone coming into you know tour the university or whatever else and then Just anyone coming into downtown it's like a five bedroom brand new construction Sam It actually looks like the kitchen looks somewhat similar to the place you just like me to so So why haven't you bought like five shelves in the tile backsplash and all that? Why I mean about like yeah, that's my same area my question Yeah, it's a million dollars. It's a million dollar or nine hundred thousand or whatever you said under a million dollar house That's making 20 15 grand a month.

Why don't you buy 50 of them? Well, I just bought this one and so it's not making that yet, but that's what we're like the bookings for the summer So it's at I just did 8,000 for January locked in and then the summer bookings are coming in at like quite a bit higher like so the January ones You know our last minute and Boise is slow and there but Yeah, the summer ones are coming in at eight nine a thousand dollars a night 800 900 or a thousand a night which is wild and we haven't even put a hot tub on it yet so I just bought a hot tub today and So we'll get that in there should be able to charge a little bit more and it's gonna be good Wow, so we should start we should intro intro you Well, yeah, so you're we're all we're live that Michael live.

This is Nathan Barry Nathan Barry I've known Nathan since a gum road meetup Sean. I went to a gum road meetup in like for real. I'm not joking That's us maybe 2012 2013 Nathan was doing gum road. He had this book called authority, right authority. Yep and I don't even remember what the book was about just making a living online, but then you also had graphic design stuff And you had a really cool blog and you you sold all types of stuff But I've been homies with you for a while and then you launched this thing called convert kit And I was like Nathan like the other things work and just do that at anyway now It's a business that both Sean and I I think I didn't end up.

I didn't end up doing it There's some Mechanics problem with the way we can get into it. We're an LLC in it. It gets complicated As like pass through funds and stuff like that. But yeah, but Sam you're I'm in I'm in the cool club and basically his business convert kit does like 26 I think million dollars in pursuing revenue. It's like a Mailchip competitor. That's better and different There the revenues all completely live. So if you Google convert kit revenue, you're like 20 revenue 29 do you regret now that your business is actually kicking ass? Do you feel like I kind of wish this wasn't all super transparent or you know because it's good early on Transparency is great early on it gets you a bunch of people interested Then when you start winning, you know, you're giving more value than you're getting back usually by that by doing that Yes, so I think it's a great idea if it's for a mission reason and a terrible idea if it's for like a marketing reason And I actually had two friends who sat me down at one point.

They're like Nathan. This is an intervention take down your like public metrics page and Which they were right like they had talked to competitors who were like, wow, this is so helpful like you're scrolling through and they're like, you know You're competitors are doing this, right? I'm like, I know but really it's like it's a mission thing of The whole mission for the company is to help creators in a living and so if we can put this public blueprint out there That's not just like the snapshot of time where you know, you've done it with companies where you're going through and you're like Oh, they said here.

They're at 10 million. You know, you're like trying to piece together the trajectory We all have the same spreadsheets and so Like actually doing it in real time means that someone can be like, okay, I'm at 50 K. M. R. Churn is absolutely brutal right now Well, I wonder what Converket's turn was when they were at 50 K, right? And you can go back and you can find the date range and be like, oh in this time Here's all of their metrics here's how fast they're growing and everything and so it's like this for anyone who wants it It's this masterclass where you have to dig in and find the data but you can find everything about our business And my hope is that it's like breadcrumbs that every future entrepreneur who wants to how much recreate How much traffic does that hopefully another industry? Do you know what's that? How much traffic does that page get? I? Don't know.

It's not actually even our page. It's convert kit dot bare metrics calm, right and It's not even ours. So wow presumably not that much Okay, so you're for real not using it for marketing if you don't even know how much traffic it gets okay now I believe you but when you said the mission thing I Have a I have a system of tuning out whenever anybody says values mission vision things like that I'm just like by default. I do not believe anything you're about to say for the next 30 seconds How many how many people work there now 69 because when you You wrote this blog post to you I forget I've been reading your blog for so long I don't remember the years, but you wrote a blog post and you're like, oh, we're making let's say eight million dollars a year but we basically had twenty thousand dollars in the bank or That's I don't remember the exact numbers, but it was almost as extreme as that right yeah, so Company's totally self funded.

There's no outside capital And so when we hit like this period of rapid growth we grew from two thousand a month to a hundred thousand a month in 12 months and You know and that was just on 50 grand that I'd put in we spent all of that money And so what happened is the company was growing and profitable But we were doing like three percent profit margins And so we got down to the point where we had I think like 10 to 12 thousand dollars in the bank And like that was growing but we were like expenses were increasing by so much more that Like our days worth of expenses was getting shorter and shorter and so that got super scary He was want to know okay random story so I Think you all know Andrew Warner Mixer I was at a Mixer G meetup in San Francisco like he would do these scotch nights and After one of those like I think we're walking out of the building and he's like dude You know I kind of pulls me aside.

He's like did you seem super stressed? and And I was like yeah, like and I kind of told him the financial situation and we were like our bank balance was growing, but you know you're like now paying all these people and you have no money and So I told him about that and and he said okay, here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna wire you twenty five thousand dollars tomorrow You're going if you need the money spend it do whatever you whatever you want with it whenever you feel right like pay me back Or if you don't need it like just put it in a savings account Like just let it be in and you know like an insurance blanket for you and then You know wire it back at some point.

Did you know him? Well, the only thing if you We'd hung out in person. I think twice before so I knew him a little bit What are you doing podcast? And what are you gonna say the only thing why oh? The thing he said is like if you do decide to raise funding like convert that into you know Like I'll be the first person in for that If not why are the smart move? Okay, but I think that move The thing that he said is the only thing that will piss me off on this is if you ever try to pay me interest on it Like don't try to make this alone in any way and so I held on to the money It sat in the bank account for like eight or nine months We grew our bank account to the point that we had plenty of savings in the bank and all of that and I wired the money back and like Andrew is forever one of those people where I'm like, thank you just because he pulled me aside It was like did you seem stressed and he was like Let me loan you a security blanket.

That's one of the coolest stories. I've heard that's frankly. That's amazing Shout out to and we got a we got a hand around now just for that story We've joked about it before but we should have them on for sure Because it is if he's done it to you. He's probably done like some weird stuff like that to a bunch of people So that's he's probably had some interesting stories Yeah, I mean he knows everyone too. So he's looking at your guys's revenue. There's a huge spike every November What did you do is like a black Friday deal or what what causes this huge? Yeah, we can talk about whether that's a good idea or not So early on right when you need cash The thing that you do in sass is you push annual plans, right? Because you have this Cacheful problem and so we started pushing annual plans as part of our black Friday sale, you know to bring forward a bunch of that cash And so we kind of just kept doing that and then it what it did is it aligned a whole bunch of Renewals, you know annual payments right around that same time So it just keeps getting bigger and bigger right until it gets to the point that you're pulling in like four and a half million dollars in a single month You're also getting all the churn at the same time.

So I don't know that Like I like we're not gonna keep doing by the way. There's so many things like that. I'm like We're doing this. I can't really say if it's a good or dear or a bad idea. I wish I could But we're just we're just gonna keep doing it from now and then like I just kind of feel like it's gonna work out But I could totally see that like we didn't need to do any of this or that this like long term is hurting us more than the short term gain What's an example like in my DTC business as far as kind of thinking about this is We do this model that like drops new products all the time every single week We drop new products and it's great because it causes this sales spike, but it also puts you on this treadmill of New products that you have to release every week and that means you got to do photo shoots of those products every week and then that means that you have to have inventory Whether you sold your previous inventory or not you got to buy new inventory like most brands they don't do that They only buy new inventory when they're out of the old stuff.

So even though inventory sucks out cash, you know It's like well, I'm buying it because I there's I'm sold out We're not even doing that but on the other hand it's creating like that I when I look at his chart it's creating this spike every single week and I'm like, okay So that's good. These other three things are bad and like I don't know how to weigh these against each other because they're like In different categories that speak different languages and on different timescale So it's just hard to hard to know if this is like a dumb idea or a bad idea or a good idea I think the thing to look for in that is Is something that served you before might not serve you now so like that served us really well for a period of time Because it brought in this cash, you know And you could tell the team like hey like payroll is good We're set for a long time and it gives that level of comfort and also like in the early days turn is often high in a business just because you don't have very many mature accounts and so locking that in is really good But then if you get to this long, you know much later in the business, you're like look We're on a cruel accounting it we don't really care.

We have plenty of cash in the bank Like this spike at this time doesn't make a difference right and so just I watch for those things where it's like this served the business Well for a while and it doesn't anymore Who built the early version? So I did all the design in front of development and then I hired freelancers to You know write the rails back end and then that went okay And then it went much better when I hired a longtime friend named David to come on and like full time Build it but that was two years in and you and it was making enough it was making enough money to pay him No, that was where I paid him out of the 50 grand that I put in which was like our our savings and everything Seems like a pretty good return I mean 50k and you're able to get that built and turns into what it is now And at least it got you to enough revenue to pay people.

Yeah, yeah And I mean it's wild what you can do when one you're doing a lot of the design and code yourself You know, so you got to count that and in the cost but But but yeah, and then you just find it with that makes it sound easier than it is But you know you fund it with growth Simple and not easy simple not easy. So so Shawn Nathan He's got this blog post called like how to how to build well. I think it's called another blog post Ladders of wealth. He's got it. This actually this other great blog post called the billion dollar creator I think it's called or the billion dollar blog.

Let's do the billion dollar. Let's do the billion dollar one All right, sorry to Sam. I don't know where you're going with that Well, well, I just want to say so this whole thing about transparency So Nathan, I don't think you publicize this but I'm on this email list and And every month or week probably month, I think he sends out dude I it's the craziest shit I've seen he sends out his entire net worth and you could see like how much cash He has how much like which stocks he owns of and of how much Like his angel investments like you see his entire file all of his finances.

I gotta get on this list. This sounds amazing It's all the content that I wanted to That I wanted like other people to publish like Sam you talk about fat fire and like that's a fantastic subreddit Um And I just want like more of those conversations because I've written a ton about people who have or like how to get from Say like zero to a hundred thousand dollars On the internet, you know, that's you mentioned my book authority. That's what that was um But like once you kind of get to the point where you're making a hundred thousand two hundred thousand or more online Like people don't talk about What you do with their money because you know if you do that someone's like, oh, you know like There's sam just bragging about how much money he has again or you know something like that And so I was like, okay, I'm gonna make a private newsletter and I just charge people a hundred bucks like just to filter out the the uh Anyone who's gonna complain about it.

I guess or say that I'm bragging And then just say I'm gonna write about all the stuff that I wish I knew when I made like my first 250 grand Online and so the way that I I described your blog or that email is it's kind of like face tattoos and cornrows I think it's super cool when other people have them, but I don't want it Like, you know, not not for me, but I I it's cool when others have them There's only 200 people on that list So it's it's a small group right now Dude, I don't know man, but Sean, what was your question about? Well, I wanted to kind of walk through the the the framework here.

So you have this blog post That's kind of like I know you worked on that for a while uh kind of shaping your thinking here and um, and then we also have sam who's somewhat Bearish on the idea of the creator economy thinks it's kind of overhyped over Buzzword and you're mr. Creator economy in a way, uh, Nathan, so I think this will be this this might be good Um, but let's walk. I don't think our opinions are opposites by the way I would I would say probably our opinions are not opposites. Yeah, for the sake of an argument Let's just uh, let's just walk through so you basically have these four rules of building a billion dollar audience So, um, I guess like first why did you even want to do this? Like kind of like what got you interested in this and then let's walk through the four.

Yeah So the article asks a question like the whole premise of it and that is what is the most profitable? Uh place to direct attention, right? So everything we do right? We're recording a podcast now Whatever you're doing on on tiktok or if you're a movie star or everything else, right? You have attention and brands want it. They're willing to sponsor You know all of this stuff and so it's like, okay You have the opportunity to point that attention somewhere. What's the most profitable way to do that long term? because you look at people, um You know, maybe who are taking sponsorships, right? Five grand, uh, you know to sponsor the newsletter, you know, 500 bucks for a sponsored, um uh instagram post or anything like that and That's actually not that profitable And then we when you dive in you learn that the most profitable thing to do is to create your own product And to drive that attention to something where you actually build equity long term So it's like a longer Uh article talking about that but like the richest movie stars, you know, like take Jessica Alba for example, right? She has made a lot of money from movies But the bulk of her wealth is from starting a company using, you know being the spokesperson for her own company um, and then my other favorite example would be ryan reynolds, um who You know, right? He's doing ads for other people and probably getting paid a million bucks here 10 million dollars there You know that kind of thing and at some point he goes like forget that I'm going to buy my own companies with mint mobile and aviation gin and I'm going to be my own spokesperson So I don't get cash.

I get equity and so you know, you just watch this process of people doing it over and over again and that's actually my hypothesis with convert kit, right of I have attention on the internet through running a blog Um and a newsletter and all of that How do I want to monetize it? I want to monetize it through Convert kit building a SaaS company like that's my version Of the billion dollar creator. So that's the whole premise of the article and it's like uh So you have you have a couple of examples. So okay, so rule number one is you have to build more than a personal brand So what does that mean? You give the example of Jessica Alba? Mark from primal kitchen.

So what is the nuance here? It's like it's not just your face your name You need to actually create a brand around uh around your lifestyle or your interest. Is that it by the way Sean primal kitchen is The sugar free ketchup company that I like. So this guy named mark. He's like kind of looks like the 65 year old version of me But like even more jacked And he like has a health and health blog and he starts selling ketchup and he sells that for like 300 million dollars Yeah, so I mean what mark did With uh, I mean his blog was called marks daily apple and it was like the leading You know like paleo Yeah, kind of health blog in that space and a blog like that, you know When he was doing this 2006 2010 that kind of thing you can make a million bucks a year off of that blog and he was Right, but you play that forward Um, that's it's all about him all about his name.

Um, all the right his name is in the Name of the site, but you can build substantial wealth that way what he didn't said is he started primal kitchen You know kick started this whole brand by saying like I have the most popular site in the space. Let me you know make these paleo friendly ketchup mayonnaise that kind of thing and then he goes, you know, how big his audience was Do you know how big is how much traffic he had at the time? It wasn't huge huge like no bigger than ours Yeah, I think he's like He's no bigger than ours.

Yeah 100,000 subscribers on the email list maybe 100,000 was the kind of like trusted audience size To kick kick off the same. Yeah, you gotta remember audiences were a lot smaller like even just 2015 2012 like that kind of time frame But yeah, then he sold the cells that to craft for 200 million dollars. You can't sell a blog To like a blog doesn't sell for 200 million, you know Like all of these things and the crazy thing is he still owns the audience Right the thing that that kick started this whole product. He still owns he can sell off the that whole brand talking to him at a Conference, you know, he's just on to the next thing figuring out what he wants to do next He didn't have to sell his his name and her whole identity with it And craft is so thrilled with their purchase Kylie cosmetics is probably the biggest one that people know about because you have tons of attention through instagram tick tock whatever the tv show whatever and uh Instead of just saying hey, I'll you can pay me Because people will use to say wow you have to pay 25 000 for a tweet from kim Kardashian or Then it that was 25 000 then it went up to like 250 000 then two million dollars for an instagram post from is it two million dollars? It got it got up to that range where it was like either hundreds of thousands or low millions to get like an actual like endorsement post from from one of them and And so then you know cool you can make a lot of money doing that You're right.

You can you can stack up quarter million dollars at a time But Kylie cosmetics was a billion dollar brand. So it's like well, who wants to who wants to pay me To promote their products. Well, it's mostly like skincare products makeup products or for kim Kardashian It's her shapewear like you know like uh, and cloy Kardashian. It was like, you know fashion or whatever So cloy launches true american jeans Kim Kardashian launches. I think it's called what was it shate? Is skims skims is like the shapewear brand dude, Sean you're on top of it. Keep going.

Kylie Kylie cosmetics Kanye Yeezy shoes right layers like They all turned to say who whoever is the the most willing advertiser? Actually, you become my competitor and I'm going to launch my own brand my own equity and have my own equity in this thing And there's a guy in the nba who gets made fun of for this, which is this guy lavar ball I don't know if you guys know this guy, but basically he has three sons all three wanted to make it to the nba And this guy's this like loudmouth guy. They got like a reality show around them because they're sort of like the like You know basketball version of the Kardashians.

There's three brothers and like a kind of an overbearing parent who is like Architecting their business strategy And when they were gonna the guy was going to get picked second in the draft and Nike offered him a contract and Ditas and instead He created big baller brand, you know triple B. He created his own shoe line And like the shoes kind of sucked and like, you know He didn't have the full business plan and people were making fun of him for like Oh, wow, you turned down a guaranteed 10 million dollars from Nike to like launch this thing 10 million dollars a year or whatever and it's like Actually, that was the right move now.

Maybe his execution was slightly poor, but it was actually the right move and A lot of these nba players would have been better served had they done that themselves Well, how's it going now the shoe thing? So the shoe thing is not going good. Basically the guy they had running it like was like kind of stealing from them So they fired him that was like a black mark on it. The second brother never made it to the nba So that was like a little bit of an issue Um, the first brother kind of underperformed his potential at that time Uh, and actually now that it would have worked because the the youngest brother the one who was like the the one who's kind of like He was kind of like a A fuck boy a little bit.

He's you know, it was like had a goal, you know, like a diamond grill had like a lambo at 15 And was like, you know, he was kind of off the reservation. He actually turned out to be the best one He's actually a star player and if they had kind of built it properly around him It probably would have done a lot better. So I um, Nathan, you'll get a kick out of this So like three or four weeks ago, we did this thing where we said we're going to give five g's To one or two three people who take our clips download it post it on tiktok and get views.

There's this kid who did it and I don't remember how many views he got but like our hashtag I think got 30 million views in like two weeks and this guy accounted for a lot of them and Multiple of his videos got a thousand or sorry a million views one video got so big that we drove 35,000 new members to the subreddit fat fire and they like And they complained and I was like reached out to this kid I'm like, who are you and he replies back with like Michael at you michigan.org Or over to something like that or dot you or whatever it is and I'm like, wait, dude.

Are you in college and I he calls me and I FaceTime with him and he's in his dorm room And he's young. He's in still in college. He's in his university thing and and he's really cocky not in a bad way But he's like he's got hutzpah and he goes man. I knew I was going to do this I wanted to prove to you guys that I could do it I want you to pay me money to do this now and I'm going to do this for other people and we're going to change the media game And I'm going to raise money and I was like, okay, hold on dude.

Hear me out and he goes I'm gonna go raise money for this thing Um, do you want to invest? I go bro. Listen, you do not want to raise money for this. Here's what you should do You are so talented at this that don't raise money for this But get it big and start launching other stuff on top of it And if you want to raise money raise money for that stuff and own all he owns this thing called like, um I forget what it's called future, but he's got like eight handles now that have like a million something followers I'm like, no, no, no, don't raise money for this thing man Own that forever and that's your piggy bank and your audience Raise money for like this other thing that you want to do and funnel it through there But don't sell that thing because I raised a little bit of money for my thing Which was like that and I I don't regret it because I got the outcome that I wanted But I do regret it because it definitely hit your massively handicapped because of it Yeah, well, and that's I think such a good point because you can Have that platform to launch whatever you want in the same way that you know Mark Sisson can use his platform to then go launch the next thing right? He probably has contracts that say he can't compete in the exact same space But he could do a fitness thing or he could do something else, right? Like you have the I was gonna give an example Conor McGregor is doing this pretty brilliantly in the UFC so like UFC gets knocked a lot because of they have like low fighter pay, right? Like the the percentage of revenue that they give to their fighters is way lower than other sports NBA is 50% NFL is like 50% UFC is like kind of 15 or 20% so the fighters are You know, they go out there they get their you know face beaten in and they're They'll make $20,000 off that fight or $40,000 or $80,000 and then They only get to do that two or three times a year.

So it's like a pretty brutal sport for low pay What Conor McGregor did was instead of selling the attention trying to try to make money as his kind of like service fee He created a brand around literally every part of his lifestyle. So he's like, all right, this thing's gonna get me famous But then okay, what am I famous for people like my suits at the press conferences? Cool. I'm launching a suit brand Okay, I'm Irish. I'm gonna launch an Irish whiskey Irish whiskey. I think just sold for I don't know if you know, Samless He walked away with 100 exactly then he's like Cool.

I'm super fit because I'm a UFC fighter. My body's amazing Here's my P90 X program. It's called McGregor fast. You can you can buy my program and subscribe to that and you can get fit with me Oh, you're getting fit and guess what else do I do? I recover? Okay, here's a recovery spray that I spray on my leg. That's like, you know, like makes my leg recover faster after workouts and the guy is literally just selling like every piece of his lifestyle as a independent brand Like, uh, you know, I think at one point he was thinking about launching a sports betting exchange It's like, what is the best business? Who's wants to pay me? Oh, DraftKings wants to pay me? Hmm, maybe a set of DraftKings is McGregor Kings now and I will I'll launch a competitor.

He just he just opened up a bar called the Black Ford Exactly. Oh, you know, I had good success whiskey. What else do we do? I rest out? Okay? I'm gonna so he bought a bar Not that the bar is that good as I can bar in his hometown and your bars not gonna make a ton of money But then he used that bar as the like basically the backdrop to film Him creating a stout and now he's gonna sell a stout as a new like alcoholic beverage brand and It's kind of amazing the guy's gonna become a billionaire And fighting is gonna be the lowest part of his income stream is my guess.

Which is insane. I bet you I bet you McConnor Connor McGregor, I bet you he goes well. He might make a billion. He might lose a billion I Think you could Nathan you're you're worth like Uh, did you reveal the valuation of your company? Uh, we we raised it 200 million Okay, so let's just I let's just I don't know what the facts are but let's just say you own 90 percent So you're worth 180 million dollars. Do you think that you can ever spend through that? Uh, I would have to radically change my lifestyle I don't think Is that enough? Yeah, that's so much more than enough I think I spend like 200 grand a year So if that gives you an idea if you take it like if you set aside the things like when i'm not buying assets That's your burn.

That's your actual burn. It's like 200 grand a year. So yeah, it would take a lot to Yeah to spend through uh through that So do we let's go let's go to this wealth ladder thing. Well, I I saw there's a point. Uh, I'll go so what what shaman was saying about um um uh Like the trend between all of these people is that that's what's in the rule number two of selling products not attention And that's the flip right so connor mcgregor is a perfect example of this Because everyone's expecting people to sell attention, right? That's the the nascar logos plastered all over the car Equivalent of that you're like great connor's doing that every celebrity and so, you know, you expect that um everyone like Every influencer is going to do that and the wealthiest people are the ones who are like great.

I'm I'm going to not do that I'm going to promote my own product Connor's the extreme example of like I'm going to do 10 of these or something most people are like let me do one or two But that's where you're going to build this real wealth And then let's just hit the other rules real quick. So rule number three drive higher customer value through recurring or repeat purchases So you'd rather have a a product that you could that has repeat purchase rate versus a one off. That's the big idea there Yep Yeah, and that's the thing of if you just look at the most valuable brands you see that uh, a lot of them are selling a product that someone buys Many times Right.

Yeah. So, you know, if my first million created a idea journal It's probably not going to have super high repeat purchase rate because you're you know one journal will last you a long time Versus if we made uh, you know the pure money deodorant and pure money deodorant is something that you would go through every two months Then that consumable is going to be worth more than you know, so product selection is important here Yep, and so even just going back to the catch up example, right? Right, you know, you're going through catch up every month every couple months You know, that's way better than something that uh lasts forever, right billionaires catch up great.

Okay. So then last one, uh, choose a better business model. So, um What do you what are you pointing out here with choose a better business model? Yeah, so there's a couple things in this one is uh, well, I'm using the example of Uh, Vani Hari who has the food babe. Um, so she had information products business She's selling cookbooks meal plans all of that and then she teamed up with uh a friend of mine Derek Halpern Who was also in kind of that online business space and they went and made uh like a health supplements company And so it's completely different.

They've made this switch from you know, that business model into Uh selling this product that people are buying on a recurring basis that you know, the brand can be acquired But then I think the other example that's interesting. Um, I love listening to Andrew Wilkinson on the show and You know, he did his whole thing. His whole thing is using Uh a very cash flow positive business right in meta lab of they're doing agency work Honestly, it's a very profitable business, but it's not valued that high in the market. And so he's like, okay, I'm gonna take Low to medium quality revenue and use it to go buy really high quality revenue, you know, because agencies they're not as recurring.

They're not Um high multiple if you want to sell the business. So it's like great I'm gonna go buy software companies or start software companies, you know, and so I'm gonna trade in You know one set of revenue for another um and then uh You see this a lot in software where someone will launch to like you'll have two versions of the same tool One's like the wordpress plugin version where it gets it done and all of that But none of those really turn into like substantial companies And so the ones that made it Are like optin monster where they built a wordpress plugin.

It was okay made millions of dollars But like it's not Valued like a software company Whereas when they go and rebuild uh like side bulky rebuild optin monster as a sass platform Added more features, you know, they can charge a different pricing model Um all of that and And then it's really valuable, right? You get to raise money at silicon valley valuations. You get to sell the company at those multiples Um, even though it's like fundamentally accomplishing the same Uh, let's talk about three people who I think left money on the table. You named two of them.

I have a third actually you might have named all three Um, okay, so you talked about remit seithi who you think, you know, maybe he's making 10 million a year in revenue Selling kind of high end courses his audience is all around personal finance And he pointed out like at the time where he had a bunch of audience and trust in personal finance and was advocating for a philosophy of like, hey You know low fee index fund style investing set it and forget it Um, you know saving a certain portion of your revenue He could have built wealth front which just got acquired for 1.4

billion, you know yesterday or something like that Uh, which was like a robo advisor doing just that so instead of selling courses Could have built a software product. So left left some value potentially on the table Um, another one is tim ferris, right tim ferris as makes a ton of money on sponsorships and ended up making a ton of money through investing in the right startups because of his brand name but You know, could he have done what joe rogan did with like on it supplements, right? Like I think tim ferris has a huge trusted audience if he said look, I tried every supplement and here's my issues with them So i'm launching the paleo ketchup.

I'm launching the neutropic supplement. I'm launching the The protein powder whatever whatever he could have picked You know, I think is is a 500 million dollar business given the size and trust of his audience But it seems like he didn't go that path. So what do you think of that of that? Oh, the third was marie for the third. Uh, I think you had her in here Uh, and I think you pointed out and yeah, you pointed out two things She builds everything in her name instead of uh building like brands that can be Dissociated from like her person the product is Her telling you content her selling you time and consulting or whatever else her selling you a course Versus her creating a product based on her belief system and you trust her so you think this product is going to work for you.

So But listen to this shon you're well, you're not exactly but you're criticizing these people You're doing the exact same thing. So you've got this big audience of people who like and trust you It shockingly trust you and do what you say But you're building this other thing that people are begging to know what it is like. Do you think that like? Uh, you're you should follow your own advice here. Oh, totally. Um, you know, that's why I like this article I think it's an eye opener for It pieces together a bunch of like anecdotes and philosophies and by the time you read it all the way through you're like, yeah, of course Of course, I agree with this.

So I did it in a way with the fund. So for example podcast Uh podcast ad revenue. I think our first year I made like 70,000 or something like that in podcast ads. It wasn't much it was like a very the the value of the audience I felt was bigger than the The value of the trust in the audience was bigger than the ad revenue And so I bet on that. I was like, okay. Well, what if I raised a fund from these people who have been listening? And I'm not going to take any I'm not going to do any pitch meetings.

I'm not going to make a presentation I'm just going to say hey if you trust me from this podcast and you want to invest alongside me in startups, you can And so now that fund is like an eight million dollar a year investment vehicle So if you just take the math on that, right? You get 2% of that in management fee. Okay, that's not that much, but then you get 20% of carry So 20% carry means you're basically getting 1.6 million of startup equity that you're investing per year for free So 70,000 in ads versus 1.6

million in startup equity of which I get to pick the startups and I think those startups can You know, what if that's 5x in the next, uh, you know, seven to 10 years? So that means each year I'm getting Something like five million dollars a year of value out of a product created from the podcast. So that's an example of doing it Example of not doing it is I do a course In the reality is I do the course just because I I like teaching and be I like the instant cash flow from that because I can go buy stupid shit with it So for example, I Like I was I stopped teaching my course because I just got busy doing other shit And then I really wanted to go like do some random NFT speculation and I was like, uh, feel stupid Doing this with my money.

What if I just like did a course for, you know, two weeks And then that let me go buy a board ape and a crypto punk and whatever else. Okay, that sounds more fun Um, and so I'm like, yeah, I'm down to, you know, teach successions to do that That seems like a good trade in my head mentally But I would say that's not actually a good use of time and then the new thing we're building the new product Is kind of in that boat, right? The milk road isn't called Sean's crypto newsletter. It specifically has A new brand name and it has like staff around it and it's a product that if it works Can be big and it'll be super charged or kind of initially initially Distributed by people who already follow me and like my content And then the second criticism which Nathan can address which is like and maybe remit would say this He's like, well, but I like blogging and I don't know anything about starting like a a fintech company Like a per a fintech company and what's what's your reply to that Nathan? Yeah, I mean, I think that's a great answer and like all these people who I like lightly pick on in my article They're all friends and and so that's one where like you got to choose the business model That's right for you but answer the question of like, okay, can this audience that I have Make me a billionaire trying to have as many examples of like that's the outcome that you want You know, or maybe it's not a billionaire, right? Because you raise money or something else but getting on that hundreds of millions of dollars Type scale then it's like, okay.

Well, here's the framework that it has to happen And if you're saying like look, you know these we listen to people who have amazing businesses, right? They're can complete control of their time making millions of dollars a year You know, like absolutely no complaints there. So this is all on the case study of like, how would you do it? actually one of my favorite examples, I used Michael Hyatt as an example in this article and he replied like he sent me an email right after it and said like hey We actually discovered the exact same thing Personal brand entirely.

We're selling digital products. We're very tied to our email list. We're doing like sponsors and stuff like that And we realized like oh this business is gonna, you know reach some limits And so he then built out all these sub businesses. They built out a journal product, you know other physical products And realized okay, how can we build what take what we have now and use it to leverage? You know other independent brands and like kickstart and launch them And so it's fascinating to like use someone as an example and then have them come back and be like you're spot on In describing our business, but you're actually two years like you were spot on two years ago We realized the same thing.

We're fixing it and now like everyone will see the result a little while from now and so Uh, yeah, if people want this path, you know, that's that's the way to go about it How big is this how many notebooks does this guy sell? I don't know that I have The numbers I'm trying to think what he what he put in the article, but it's uh His other products are now bigger than all the things that we know him for so in the tens of millions of dollars That's crazy. Um, all right. What are we saying Sean? I was gonna jump to the ladders of wealth because I think this is the other kind of nice framework that you have so um, and this is kind of like I think some people have heard of kind of stuff like this, but I just want to like lay out the fast version and then we can go into whatever's Whatever's interesting from this.

So you have this image of uh, of a series of ladders And it's not like one ladder that you just go up up and up. It's basically like If you use if you choose this method of wealth creation, your ladder can be this high Your ladder can be this high, but if you choose this method of wealth creation, it can go one rung higher Or it can go two rungs higher or four rungs higher depending on which one you choose. So here's here's how it works So it's basically the lowest ladder the smallest ladder is you're selling time for money So that's having a job or being uh, yeah having a job basically Then there's your own service business.

So this might be like an agency You're charging by the project. You have some clients you charge some hourly rate Whether you're you know, it doesn't matter if you're like making logos for some company or you're a lawyer You're actually in the same boat. You have a service business with clients you charge an hourly rate Then there's product side productized services, which is um It's given a given example of a product of product. Yes. So the example would be Let's say I charge a hundred dollars an hour to redo the copywriting on your website You know and so I'm I'm doing that or I say for a thousand dollars one time you can buy it with a credit card You know, I will go and rewrite your site, you know, or write you one whole landing page Um, and so there's a couple really important things there One the purchase is being made without me talking to you like if I'm charging a hundred bucks an hour We'll probably have a conversation.

You're like we're planning that Um, second thing is it's prepackaged Uh, so you know exactly what you're buying Um, and then the the third thing is that the time and money are totally disconnected So if I get better and better, uh, if I hire people any of that, right? Like I'm not having to sit there for 10 hours and do it Um, and so there's a bunch of these skills that they have to learn uh to do the product side service An example a simple example We I think uh, ryan biegelman came on the pod long time ago and he talked about drop servicing Which was a version of this so like uh the the example he was given is like There's these products that are like, um You pay $30 and I'll draw a picture of you and you give me a picture of you and I'll draw you as a simpsons character Or like you can send this as a gift.

So somebody loves the simpsons. You can give me a photo of them I'll draw it as simps character. You get it. So it has all the elements you talked about self serve You come in has a predefined price. You just click a button and you pay Um, you get a defined product and product out of it. So we're kind of both clear on the bargain And then third you don't know how long it takes me. You don't know how much it costs me I don't have to do the work myself. So with a lot of these character services It's like it just gets piped to a you know person in the philippines who's an artist They take the gig they submit it they get seven dollars The the service keeps, you know, whatever $23 and uh, and it's all done.

So that's like an example of a product side service And uh, by the way, isn't there like a facebook group called product side service? Who runs that? There's a guy running that's pretty interesting. We talked about him Yeah, uh, green green. Do you know the guy's name? Green felt maybe or something like that So so what he does is he's got this facebook group and the reason like it's so niche But it's actually pretty valuable for if you're in that niche. So he has this facebook group called productized services or something like that productized businesses and um And what he was doing was he would just show an example so he'd say oh look, this is a real estate agent And before here's how it used to work.

You know, here's their page. Here's their face call them up become a client blah blah blah And he's like, oh, sorry. That's not a good example. It's I make what I design websites I can code anything you can hire me as a freelancer And then he changed it to a productized service, which is you're a real estate agent You need a website for your company. I make real estate agent websites Come here pick one of the six templates push go. I'll give you a website And I'll charge you a fixed fee of 250 dollars or 500 dollars to give you that website And so it's basically a way of productizing a um a service You know what the best name that I've ever heard for that is jack butcher who's our friend and he has this course It's got it's a beautiful.

It's called build once sell twice. It's so good It's such a good name. I took the course. Yeah. What did you love it? Yeah, I loved it just because everything jack does is done so well. So, you know, uh, He could, you know, write me a birthday card and I would be like, wow, I love birthday cards now It's like, do I really love birthday cards or do I just love jack butcher? I think I just love jack butcher actually Yeah, his ability to take something and like distill it down to the absolute essence And like build one sell twice is that like it's selling products, you know, we're saying, okay I can make this thing a single time and and then sell it to you I can make this thing a single time and and then sell it as many times as I want Which everyone talks about the upside of that of like, oh, this is gonna be amazing Right? I can build this and sell it a whole bunch of times.

No one talks about the downside That like it's so freaking hard to do the first like to make the first one You know, whereas if I'm building a one off thing, like using websites, for example, like, okay I'm supposed to build a website for Sam. He's paying me 2000 bucks. Like I build this out It's not that hard. I can use my skills to do it Like building a website builder, you know, that's incredibly hard And so you have this like trough for a long time where you're not going to make money in the short term But the the like leverage is incredible How old are you now? 31 So you're 31 as long as I've known you we've known each other since we're both like 23 24 You've always pretty much been the same where you were pretty calm Very patient.

I would say patient would probably be the best word to describe you And there's been a lot of times I remember in 2014 or something like that I didn't have much money But I hollered at my really rich friend and I was like man Nathan is doing like a hundred grand a month like in revenue. This thing's gonna be big You should try to invest and maybe I could broker a deal and you and uh, if I did that then I met you You probably had a ton. You've also probably had a ton of people who were trying to buy the company for a life changing amount of money And you've probably had loads of other Um Opportunities so my question is how have you stayed pretty calm and also incredibly patient throughout all this? I the patience is something I struggle with your Sean was telling you about uh, how he launches like a new does a new drop every week and like and I I think that that's rooted in like Oh, but we need the numbers to go up this week And like you got caught and I've done this I do the same thing where I'm like, but it's not growing now And I mean so how have you done so patient and long term focused? Well, I think part of his personality and you're right that like uh patient and relentless are probably two things you can Use to describe me back then uh and now but I think a lot of the ideas that are in some of these articles or that I try to write about Is really in building this one thing.

So I think about uh What analogy that like is strip malls versus skyscrapers? Let's say we're getting into real estate development and we've got a piece of land and you're trying to decide okay What what should we build on it? And so you want to make money quickly? And so you build like Uh, you know first little office building or something you got like a radio shack there Now you're make you got a little bit of cash flow coming in You know you want to expand so you build another you add on to that now We've got a subway and we're we've built it out and we've got a little strip mall or a shopping center And that's like we're going to use up our land each time we're expanding horizontally And so we're you know launching a new product the the version of this is the Like the blogger or podcaster or someone who's like I've got my ebook my membership site my Whatever other thing that I'm doing You know I keep adding and each one makes a little bit of money My approach on everything is the skyscraper model of like I'm going to do one thing And I'm going to keep pouring everything into that and just keep going taller and taller and taller and makes it and so like Converting is my Attempt at a skyscraper and like in the billion dollar creator article.

It's all about people. I think you are building those skyscrapers You've not you've not always done that actually I think and I think that that's a good strategy But I would actually say it's pretty cool that you've not always done that and I'll give you an example But the reason why it's cool is because like you're flawed and you do you you definitely have your your even though You're incredibly patient and long term thinking like maybe it's not rooted in this probably but like there are some examples For example, like you've done a bunch of book launches.

You've launched like eight or nine things that that have sucked You did this great twitter thread. Were you well? No, he did this twitter thread Yeah, he goes here's the nine things that I've created that were horrible No, he had a threat. I don't know if you saw it suck. Maybe he said fail Yeah flopped or something like that. So in that Uh, this is something else, right? Like we all want to jump in and build the most perfect product Uh, and you can't do that because there's all of these skills that you have to learn like that's the point of this ladders wealth creation article is that Like business and building wealth is the combination of like a thousand little skills And if you try to do it all at once You know, like you're going to fail and so that's like in these ladders the one point that I'm trying to make is that but like You know, I put marketplaces and social networks, you know at the top of the hardest ladder And then just below that is sass because if you think about the number of skills that you have to know in order to do that Like sam, what was uh, the first product you sold online? Um, I uh, well there was two it was liquor So I sold alcohol on the internet and then I also created a guide on how to how to find a roommate in san francisco Okay, so that guide like do you remember? As you were trying to figure out how to collect payments for that or like how to put together a page that would sell it That's why he was at the gum road meetup.

Yeah I ended up using gum road because it was so stressful. I couldn't figure out. I was like, well, I was like I remember going to Shopify. I'm like, well, just Shopify. Let you sell pdfs. How does that work? So yeah, I remember those things right you're trying to figure out how to do Okay, okay How to collect money on the internet is something that you have to learn and now we're just like We get that we could rattle off a whole bunch of ways, right? But Someone's starting out saying hey, I want to get into this.

They don't know how to collect money on the internet They don't know how to write headlines. They don't know how to collect email subscribers. Why that even matters, right? All of these things And so I think the best way to do it is to learn Through a bunch of these other little products, right? And so that was like basically what you're seeing all the way along with the ebooks and everything else Is me learning all of the skills that ended up culminating and being able to build a convert Yeah, that's fair And then the other thing is like if I say I only focus on convert it like that's not fully true because I like to have Contrast in my life.

I think that's something that helps and so like we started off You know riffing on some real estate stuff and the reason that I like it is because you spend all your time sitting in front of a computer And so doing something tangible like Airbnb or something in the real world like to me is the opposite Because I get to actually go see a real property. I get to uh, you know Visit in person. It's a totally different experience my friend, um, shan blanc says If you work with your mind, you should rest with your hands And that's I like that idea Of like just doing something that's the opposite And so I think if you give yourself these little indulgences of like Uh Buying a house in Airbnb or starting like a one off paid newsletter that you run an autopilot or shan What you're doing where you're like run out and make a course and then you're like, okay, that was fun I think that can be a creative outlet that then helps you focus on the main thing Rather than saying like oh, I'm gonna go create 10 main things When you've been creating convert it Um, let's say that either you've sold the company and you still want to like do interesting things Or you're 21 or 25 years old and you want to start something what interesting opportunities or problems that need to be solved Have you've discovered where you're like, I can't do that now But it'd be pretty cool if someone like someone could totally get into the blank and do blank Yeah, okay, this is uh honest But a terrible answer to your question because of the net because I also did it right um is As we were doing email marketing, you know and running the newsletters for like James Claren tim Ferriss and everyone else Um, the thing that I wanted to do was then get into commerce of like, okay We have this whole side of it, right? Where we're sending all the emails have the connection to the fans now.

I want to build um The like the credit card processing and and I want to get a cut of everything that they sell um, and so then I realized like oh And that was always the answer Uh, actually if someone was like if you weren't doing convert it, what would you do now? I always said I'd go start a gum road competitor And then the nice thing is there's that synergy there. So it's like, okay. I went and started a gum road competitor called convert to commerce It's in the same product. So it's like uh Both a realistic answer and probably not very satisfying for you because it's not like totally different gum road has been around for a long time now Up until recently they pretty much had never done anything to change it um, and no one is competing with them But there's a downside it doesn't make that much money Like I actually don't know what it makes anymore But as of a couple or a few years past Like he would tweet out his revenue and like it was really hard to build a business where he was making like 4% of someone's like $10 pdf You know what I mean? It was it was a challenge to business.

Well, that's why you have to build a build a better business model Right and so if you look at something and say how could we improve that business model? The thing that I saw in that is like, okay uh, what if We had another product alongside it that we sold and right so for a convert kit we make money off of uh, your email subscription and so I now have these two things that go hand in hand and so Uh, the commerce side is really good because now Like we're able to for every one of our customers, right? Who's selling products we're able to make a little cut of that and they don't feel like they're paying us anything extra Because it's just a bit of the credit card processing fee Um, and then it also reduces our churn because anyone who's selling through convert kit commerce Um, right there now like convert is paying them Rather than uh, the other way around and so we saw a radically lower churn So I'd argue that like gumroad by itself or you know, the gumroad competitor that I wanted to start by itself You're right.

It's not that good of a business model But when you pair it with convert kit and make the creator marketing platform This is turning into a sales pitch, but you get the idea that I'm trying to make Oh, it's that like the the combination of those two things that then makes it a fantastic business model And so you have to look at okay This is working. I want to go after this in whatever space it is and then take a step back and say, okay What are the flaws in the business model? What other products do I pair it with? What other audience do I target it against? You know any of those things that actually makes it a compelling business instead of like an average business And do do you actually are you still hands on with? Convert kit or are you I know you're the CEO, but do you have someone helping you run it or are you still the guy in charge? No, I'm way too hands on Uh, the thing that people don't tell you in startups is that like the growth that you see Is a whole bunch of stacked s curves, you know of like you figure out things that work and it takes off and then it levels out And you got to figure out the next uh, plots or like the next uh stage of growth And so I'm uh Very hands on like we've had a few executives leave over the last year Uh, just a lot of change and so I'm like completely in it recruiting new executives Uh, working with the team to design the next version of the product and so yeah I'm not the the like uh case study of what you should do for the perfect execution on you're not the four hour work week I am not the four hour work week Do grind I mean, I know you got like 18 kids Uh Three I know I I just because as long as I as long as I remember you I think your all this are like you had your all this when you were young And so I always would tease of like what do you have like 40 kids now? You always had a couple And uh, but you are you grinding right now or do you have is it a 40 hour work week? Uh, it's it's right now.

It's a lot more than a 40 hour work week But it's interesting of trying to structure that around like kids You know of it's a lot of like waking up early You know or like this weekend, uh, we're headed out for our team of treat like meaning of a up in person So I'm leaving saturday morning. So like this morning when my kids woke up early. I like We went out of the house and like spent two or three hours together You know before because I know I'm gonna work all day and and then be gone all next week.

So, uh, Yeah, I don't work a crazy amount, but at least like 50 to 55 hours a week is probably what I am for So I don't know if that counts as grinding, but it's definitely not not relaxing It's in the middle. Yeah in the middle. I think of grinding and not grinding Um, what do you think son? Uh, I think it's great. You know, I think convert. I'm a user. So I uh, and I complained to Nathan all the time I'm like, I'm paying too much for convert kids. He's like You do complain about that and he was good and I just point out how much money you make.

Yeah, he was like, um But you know emails like making you all this money and I'm like, yeah But I just feel like emails free and like this should be free and I was like I was like, can I just get this for free and he's like, well, you know, like let me know what you think is You know, he's very very patient with me and it was sort of like, you know, because I was like I was like, I don't know. I told Ben. I was like Ben go find like what we should use instead of convert kit And then kind of like search for a couple products and then he was like, well, you know, like they're all kind of worse But there are some cheaper options.

You want worse but cheaper And I was like, oh fuck. I gotta choose worse but cheaper. Wait, what's your what's your what's your bill every month? I think I pay like 400 a month. Maybe more. I don't even know That's what you're and how much money do you make a month? Well, see it's not about that, right? Like it's more I those are two separate things I feel like because because the email directly doesn't make me that much money It's like got it through the email I build the audience and then through the audience if I launch a product or a course or whatever Yeah, that makes a bunch of money, but that's separate work I gotta go do at the separate set of costs they go into that And so we actually did we were like, oh, should we switch and then I kind of respected that anything wasn't just like Oh, whatever it takes to stay, you know, here you go free.

I was like, I was like, uh, okay The fact that he didn't do that tells me like he knows the value of his thing And um as much as I hate that I'm you know, not getting this like free discount or whatever I respect that and so I stuck with it Nathan are you Mormon? No, I'm not Dude, you get that Mormon energy man. How often do you do that? I mostly just hear it from you Sam You've never heard that from anyone else. I mean you live in Idaho you you you had kids at 21 Like you're you work hard your audience.

It seems like you don't party you got hardcore Mormon energy all the time You gotta avoid the caffeine There's Sean what I was gonna say is uh that What what's funny is So like Tim McGraw and Arnold Schwarzenegger both have converted newsletters and they pay full price And they don't ever give me shit about it. Yeah, but then it's the it's like the internet influencers Where they're like, I should get this for free, you know, and I'm like no So it's a fascinating because we've had that a lot over the years right of people saying like hey what discount Can you give me? Do you know how famous I am? and kind of what's fun is getting into Uh, I separate them from internet famous and actual famous and the more we've gotten into the actual famous space The more it's been easy to say like no man.

Here's the value that we provide And and I think I was giving you a hard time because you had just done a thread like two weeks earlier About your paid newsletter that was making like 50 or 100 grand a month I can't remember if I like linked you to the same thread, but that's what I wanted to do in the twitter DMs So how big is how how big is Arnold's list? Oh, we can't say those numbers, but he's uh still relatively small whose list is bigger his his list or my list my list Not very big, but his I think it could be the same size as Arnold.

No way That's bitch No You know the favorite little uh like business model synergy That weekly So he was on like it's fun like as he goes around promotes his newsletter Right because he goes on like jimmy kimmel and it's talking about his email newsletter, which is is always fun Yeah, I go on indie hackers, dude But uh When like a business model thing that's funny is when one can work a customer links to another to grow their list so like when tim ferris links to uh Arnold's list and said like hey, you know go sign up for Arnold's list it added you're like 40 40,000 subscribers And it's just like our cut just goes up, you know, it's just one customer just referred to the other but now I anyway, it's a fun dude.

You got to write a blog post like The best way to grow your list partnerships. Here's like a list of like interesting people to partner with I have a VP of growth opening. Uh, do you want to come? Yeah, last episode morning brew offered me a job too. There you go. It's actually like a great power move is to just offer Uh staff writer jobs or staff jobs to CEOs of other companies just to like flex on them to say hey, you know, I heard things are tough Um, just so you know, we're always there's always a home for you here So let's just send the CEO of Mailchimp like the like A month into starting the hustle.

Um, I like we written blog posts whatever and we're I was trying to hire writers and I saw this awesome article and I and I don't remember where it was But the author was Nelly bulls. I think her name is bo w l bo Wl. Yes, and now she's like a really famous New York Times person And I think like even when I found her she was actually at the New York Times But like I just done a one off piece for this small magazine and I emailed her I'm like, you are so good. Would you love to interview for a position at my company? Like we're looking for bloggers and she was like, that's cute, but no, thanks And uh, I will never forget that she told me that's cute.

I have I have I have health as grudge against her for years because she said it's cute for years You can just imagine like the little pat on the head and the hair tossle that went with like that's cute, you know, like It's kept me up at night like so many I was like, I'm good I hope I'm gonna get revenge and I don't have a good way but that was like eight years ago Sam's like Arya Stark before bed every night He says a list of the names of the people he needs to like get revenge on it's like Nelly bulls I I definitely have you know, like what they say like I got like a bunch of champagne bottles But people's names on it and whenever I get back at them I crack that champagne bottle open a drink Like yeah, I want some people's heads on my desk.

That's for sure We have the buddy Not much turns out Not much Yeah, just don't call me cute Just be like, you know comment on one of his instagram, you know videos and just be like Awesome for a beginner Just like you move on You're still at it awesome We uh, we have a buddy who is like the nicest guy in the world like, uh, you know, we'll give you the shirt off his back and uh Nice to everybody kind of strangers kind of animals kind of everybody and you go into his house and on his fridge He's got this like clip art picture of a of a brand name of another company's logo with a Target and like kind of like a red target like a sniper Um, and he's got three on one his fridge and I remember going over like what's this about and he's like Oh, yeah, he's kind of like, you know, those are my those are my competitors I just every day when I come to the kitchen, I just want to think about you know, just sort of killing them basically I was like, whoa A dark side to the uh to mr.

Nice guy here Do you have one of those Nathan? I would bet anything Nathan does not have anything like what we're talking about He's got you are so wrong. I bet you that he he will I don't know if he'll admit it. I bet you he hates male chimp Oh, see I have weird feelings about male chimp because I have so much respect for them and like Dude, you have respected them like the guy who killed John Lennon has respect for him It's called a love knife. You love him so much you want to kill him.

That's like what it is It's like the guy who like killed the pope. That's what you're gonna do So you have to separate the businesses like the business from the people So I think that's true like one time, uh, I was at a conference and Ben Chestnut was speaking and so I emailed him and was like, hey, man will you I don't know even know why he said yes, but it's just like like big fan of what you've done Like all in all fairness were a competitor trying to take as much business from you as you can But would you be up for sitting down and talking and he said like yeah, I have a flight at this time So I'm checking out the hotel.

So like meet me in the hotel lobby You know and we'll chat for 30 minutes gave you the wrong hotel. Love it. Great power move Ben Chestnut Set me on this wild goose. Yeah, he's like that's you missed your flight. He never had a flight But no, he like he sat down with me and told me all about how they launched their free plan and all this stuff And then the they were uh ink magazines Uh company of the year. This is the ink magazine like the ink 5000 event And so the editor in chief from ink magazine comes up when we're talking is like, hey ben great talk all of that and uh um He ben goes.

Hey, do you know Nathan? He's trying to kill my company And like as he introduces me to the editor in chief of ink magazine and Anyway, so I have time to what it looked like if you just like assaulted him right there So like I'm gonna be jailed now. He's just still thinking like like killing Nelly bowls with a love knife or whatever For the record Nelly, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do anything Is this Sam? Is this the same person that you had the interview the famous interview with at the New York Times or the New Yorker Or whatever it was and like the interview did not go well It did not go well with her or somebody else.

No, that was uh, erin griffin And she like came to interview me and I don't even know why but she was fishing for stuff And she's like so like what are you doing the weekend? It's like listen to Joe Rogan. That's what she said to me. I'm like, what? Like no like he doesn't even like that's monday to friday. He doesn't even have a Talking about yeah, and she was like well like because you're like a tech bro and I'm like first of all Most of New York Times revenue is digital. You're a tech company.

So you tell me what your tech friends do and uh So anyway, yeah, that thing go well. Did you storm out or or how did that end something? Yeah? I was just like, I don't know what to say. I'm out of here. Yeah, I It didn't it didn't end well. That's so good Uh those interviews I've only ever had one of those. Um, I don't remember who I was with but we were like, okay I I think we're done Well, you can just tell that they're like looking for some angle and all the questions are weird And you're like, but why would anyone hate you because you're kind of perfect It's good that you bring that up It's like well, I got a lot of points.

It's true So I'm not sure what the problem is. Yeah, it's like I like this. I've got there's a lot of bad things I like to say the shower this clip of biden uh the other day when he called the Journalist was like on the way out. Did you see this clip a stupid son of a bitch? You guys like you know There's an inflat what do you think about inflation and Biden just like in that moment was just like lost it He was just like, yeah, great stupid son of a bitch That's how I imagine Nathan like breaking character in like one of these interviews So, okay, Sam I have a question on this then like do you think that being so nice and all of this and and like everyone likes me It holds back my uh growth as an entrepreneur and you know, uh internet So I want to be internet celebrity No, because um a like you're happy and it's working.

So I think that's like the goal and b you actually have dropped it a couple times So, uh, you don't have to talk about this if you don't want to but basically you didn't like what saw hill at gumroad did and you called them out and it was pretty uh It was pretty vicious and I knew that do you know this shon? No, what did he call him out for? Dude, he just like publicly kind of bitch slapped saw hill and I was like it was crazy. So Uh, so I was around uh, sam was talking about I was around gumroad from the very beginning Uh, I think I was the first independent At one point they told me I was the first independent seller to cross $10,000 in sales on gumroad.

So like from the very very beginning um and uh, anyway, so friends with tons of people there and Like spent a lot of time at their office and all of that and a huge friend of saw hills, but at one point he Like got burnt out on the company. They had an offer to buy the company He didn't take it. He laid everyone off instead Like it wound down and and like ultimately failed But the thing is with a platform like that they don't like fail and disappear They just like fail and coast and still like the software still works and all of that And then he came back and told this totally different story of like uh, here's how I You know like vc is evil and I'm running the company like in this totally new way um, here's how I run it in five hours a week with like two contractors And that was frustrating, but I didn't say anything But then when they went and raised new money and didn't give any they they got all the vcs to write off their equity They got all of the team members to be like, hey, it's a failed company like give up your equity and all that as part of it And they went and raised a bunch of new money and didn't Uh go back and give the original team members like that pissed me off because it was like, I know exactly who built the software You know like because I sat next to them as we were talking about it, you know They're off to San Francisco and like I know they don't have any equity and I know that you didn't take care of them And now you're like telling this new story and everything.

So Uh, yeah, I guess sam I do make some enemies on the internet. You do and when you said that I was like, well I was I don't know saw hill. Uh, he seems like a nice guy from my limited interactions with him But I was like, well if naphin's saying that it's probably true Yeah, you know, you could separate the person from like the decision. I've made a bunch of bad decisions Uh, but I don't think I'm a bad guy and oh me too. I've made a lot and Yeah, and so, you know, I I would separate the two like because he you know, probably a nice guy I I don't know.

I'm super well either but um But you're right. Like, you know, the the way he kind of got twitter famous in a way was to come out and tell this story of like The kind of like it was like a fail story that worked. It was like we were the hot thing We raised money. We had all these expectations people bet on us. It didn't work Um, and so now we're in this new mode and I've seen the light. It was sort of like, you know, I got baptized and now I believe Um that this business should be done this other way.

Okay fair enough Um, and some people really liked that. They thought it was very transparent and all that good stuff But it was weird that like, you know a year or two later Like I'm raising new money at a hundred million dollar valuations. Like wait, you're back on the that train like weren't you kind of saying like, you know, all the things that were wrong with that model and like Freedome. Yeah, championing the the freedom that you were getting and the choose your own destiny and getting off the rat race like Maybe I read it wrong.

Maybe I was just skimming and I missed the point but like that did seem strange to me and then like you're saying Nathan like it's kind of weird to kind of To do that whole thing in public when a whole bunch of people bet on you lost money on you and um And are not participating in the like, you know future And so that would leave a bad taste in people's mouth. I think so, you know, I think it's fair points. Um You know, and I'm sure I'm sure he's got his side of the story about why it's not bad and why it's not that and all those things So, you know fair enough, but he's not here.

So I'm just gonna say my side and Seems like that'll be the final word Uh, I mean tons of credit to to saw Hill afterwards because he Like he owned up to parts of it and we had a good conversation about it and he actually then when he launched his book Um, he actually included ConvertKit and the story in it, which I was Is really surprised so as far as people who don't hold the grudge. I think uh, so I hope one of them not Sam He's not Sam. I think He's not Sam. I hold grudges and in fact, I actually manufacture grudges.

So like there's just one guy I always call my rival and uh, I'm sure from his perspective. He's either like who is this or he's like Wait, why are we rivals? We got a lot. We got a lot of just fine and in my head this is like somebody I met in uh when I was in college and um The guy's got like a super ultra rich dad like billionaire dad and uh, I always used to joke like if I ever played basketball Uh, there usually wasn't like another Indian guy like playing basketball So if there ever was like the running joke and my group of friends in college was Well, shall we know who you're guarding like you have to guard him and you would need to win your match up here? Like your honor is on the line basically like we need to know who's the better Indian basketball player on the court right now It was just like this running joke and so that got extended once we I started a business with my college friends they were like well Seems like this guy's like, you know your rival and I played into it and we kind of made it a thing Where the guy would be like, you know hanging out with Richard Branson on this island and we were like Just trying to create a chip on our shoulder underdog story is like, you know I'd be sleeping on my air mattress that I was planning to return to target to like save money because our business wasn't doing any good And if you saw this other guy like, you know, sipping pina coladas with Richard Branson It just felt like oh those are the haves and where the have nots.

It's I was like manufacturing these little feuds or like I remember we did a we when we bought Bebo back We were going to relaunch it and I gave the scoop to this girl who was like really nice journalist to me Um, she was somebody I'd met she seemed really nice and I was like, hey Do you want the the story? Like I'll give you the story about like what we're going to do and how it all played out She's like, yeah, great. So we she comes over I do the interview. It's like Literally, you know, we're playing patty cake.

It's all good article comes out the next day and the headline is like just some vicious it's like Remember Bebo. Ha. Yeah, that you know that flop is back again. I really was just like it was like oh my god Disgusting As he told me that he told me the plan with his bad breath and I was like, what? You know like in my head. That's what it said. Like it was like as Yeah, if you like spinach go eat some of the stuff that came out of Sean's teeth. It's so probably there So I felt so backstabbed, you know, not no love knife just straight knife And I remember just being like so I never had the interview where I walked away I had the opposite where I felt completely but and I texted her I was like, yo What the fuck because actually the article was fine.

Just the headline was completely brutal it was just making fun of us and saying like get a load of this fucking schmuck and And she's like sorry like the editor writes the headlines and he just thought that that's what would get more clicks Like I don't have any say in that and I was like, oh So fuck you in your profession. It was like, you know where I landed on that Um, I think that was my only few actually my other one where I called What's her name? Uh, the jake paul of journalism was probably the other one Taylor the runs Yeah, like I think that I actually think It's great fuel.

I mean like I joke to my wife. I'm like I'm fueled on like carbonated water and like grudges like I think Grudges I think are like the greatest fuel ever like isn't that like the whole thing about being like a chip on your shoulder Like protein what it is. You would like grudges is like my macro my macro Yeah, I'm just like, yeah, like I gotta make sure I get my rage in that day. Otherwise. I just don't feel like myself It's like our egold. I just love firing people. Um, so anyway, I think it's good.

I think rage is great That's the key takeaway from this episode people listen to him. You do need like a loin. Let me go manufacture some grudges Somebody yell some every day I do like Well, it's shawnt when when we first met ben leavey or I met him the first time you were like, well, you know Sam's a little Challenging I just had to give him the heads up. I'm like don't take a personal if he kind of fires off Yeah, our egold is actually a great great analogy because there's no there's no Uh, what's it called like there's no hate behind the words, right? Like I'm yelling, but I love you Like it says nothing to do with how I how much I like you or how good I think you are I'm just yelling because I'm yelling and So I tried to give him the heads up, but you were so zen.

Uh, this was post post exit sam is a completely different guy He's uh, you know, you're not already gold anymore I'll come back in due time. Um, dude, Nathan, thanks for coming on happy. Uh, happy you're you're able to make it. I uh, I bailed on you last week. Sorry and I'm happy that we made it work this time Yeah, thanks for having me. It's always fun. What you want to where people promote your like what? Yeah Yeah, uh, okay. So if people want to follow me online, uh, I'm currently trying to grow my twitter audience So you should go follow me there.

Uh, I'm trying to see if I can go from I'm not 50,000 The hand that is 100,000 At Nathan berry And berries ba are Usually when you try to grow the audience, you should uh, tell them the name of the thing You know, I only want the most dedicated fans who like really no, I'm just kidding Thanks for the advice Add that to your ladder shove that in your ladder You know what we didn't discuss and I don't we don't have time now, but one time Sean Nathan Renamed the company convert kit to something else and he didn't realize it But it meant like something like it was disrespectful to hindus hindi's hindi.

What's the plural? Yeah, you're the first and it was disrespectful to them And he made this huge name change and they changed the company back to convert kit after like 24 hours. Wait. What was it? What was what was it? Okay, what I'm I speak any way what does that mean service? But in sea culture, it means like selfless service and like the highest form of worship Yeah, so it's a whole thing. Yeah, I'm doing it. I'm doing a service for you. I don't I don't find that offensive That's not offensive. Yeah, there were a lot of people who did find it offensive.

And so yeah, if we talk about We talk about mistakes turns out. I'm not as easily Owning up trouble. So uh, hindus didn't find it offensive and I actually had a lot of people who were like Uh, that's like thought that it was awesome or something like that. Um But uh, everyone who was from the sea culture, they were like, sorry. Yeah, it had a Much different meaning uh there. So anyway, that was a $500,000 mistake, but uh, I owned up to it. So That's the whole thing for another way That the convert kit good name the other thing like seven or whatever you're doing is Good name the other thing like seven or whatever you said not a good name like so I think Hindu worship That doesn't seem like the right name for an email.

Yeah Convert kits a great name. That's such a good name Well, so maybe it was a $500,000 mistake that will turn out to be a multi million dollar win Do you still do you still have the domain because we should just launch like a prayer service or like, you know, like a philanthropy Uh thing for india under that. I have some indian startups that might want that name. I do have the domain There's actually two startups one that went through my combinator and one other Uh that I have asked for it at one point, but I paid $340,000 for the domain.

So I'm kind of hanging on to it. Is the four letter domain letters. I didn't even know how to spell that word I just spell that word S. E. V. Yeah, right. Yeah, but um, it sounds like a bottled water Dude, I got something that you're gonna like send emails from so I think is smart move My uh, I got in trouble this morning because I wrote sorry in the milk road Edition that went out this morning One of the things we covered was like, oh the fed the fed had this meeting about interest rates and how that's affecting like the markets and uh and I was like Basically, I put a picture up of the committee that meets the fed open market committee and it's basically like a bunch of old white people And I was like, you know today, you know I had a bunch of different openers that I scrapped one was like here's a picture from a nursing home.

I visited recently Oh, wait. No, that's not right. That's the fed open market committee And I scrapped that and I said something else and then I was like, you know At today's elderly white people committee and I like I had a strike through and then I was like no at the fed open market committee It's like a rural mcdonald's at like 7 a.m. and It's like a seas candy and Um, yeah, people were like, you know, the skin color has nothing to do with it. I was like, yeah, of course It's a joke and it has everything to do with my joke and like just the picture's funny It like wait, I thought we could make fun of the fed with no repercussions like that like the there's like certain things that are really safe to punch at and uh The fed seems like one of the safest, you know the fed You know the the senate like who's who's defending their honor? I don't understand.

Who are you? Is your mom on this? Is your grandma on this panel? Oh, yeah, some people got mad at me. I was like you should go ahead and unsubscribe because uh, My filter is a lot looser than that. Yeah Um, dude, Nathan. Thank you. This is awesome Yeah, thanks for having me. We'll have to do it again sometime and we'll have to hang out in uh, Austin when you get this new property We'll come and and do a workout on the You know on the ranch Come on. Let's go It's a good challenge except a grudge initiative.

All right. See you guys
