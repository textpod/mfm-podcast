Duration: 1 hours, 5 minutes, 28 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

I used to go to an ATM machine and just put my card in and say print balance and just look at it He's like I would just do that like every day So we have an interview with micro choir they Well, we talk all about it then and and it's with it's with Andrew. He Um, he sells startups basically on micro choir. It's a marketplace for selling startups But we're gonna talk about some ideas first and catch up. I I've hired someone Jake McDonald to do research I just sent you you of course hired like a guy who looks like an egg a football player And yet he's your like business researcher guy So here's the here's the secret which is Sean has had a little bit of help with research for a very long time and he his name's Ben We've talked about Ben Ben's amazing and I got jealous and I said I want to Ben So I went and hired a Ben and his name is Jake I had Ben or had Jake call Ben to get all of his research tips and then did a really good job And I just sent to you Sean my notion doc with all Jake stuff.

It's good, right? You see how we were good Very thorough. Yeah, he's he's wonderful. So no, we're gonna we're gonna be a little bit more well research Although he doesn't start technically kind of till next week. This is kind of we're still kind of getting used to things training wheels Yeah, all right. Cool. Yeah, so basically we're gonna do a couple ideas now And then Andrew's gonna join Andrew's the founder of micro choir, which is Zillow for buying and selling companies So we bought one company on there. I bought a basically we bought it being Andrew bought a business for for this kid Who was like a college senior we bought we bought him a business to go run Just as an experiment and that was kind of the first time I used it So I think it's pretty cool.

He's gonna tell us about like his previous company which he sold for tens of millions How that deal came about how he structured it What he did with the money so we were like, alright, if you're gonna come on you gotta tell us what he did What'd you do with the money? So he tells us about what he bought how he invests money his kind of like very boring investment strategy What and why he chooses to do that? So yeah, we're gonna talk about that with Andrew, but first a couple ideas. Alright, so I want to talk about this tweet I saw and It's a tweet from Doug Ludlow.

You know who that is. Yeah, Main Street. Yeah, CEO of Main Street founder Main Street And so he tweeted this thing out. He goes Isn't it crazy that Bubba Gump shrimp the restaurant chain does like 200 or 300 million dollars a year in revenue? When Forrest Gump the movie that the brand is based on did like 700 million like lifetime box office He's like the restaurant. Hey, is that real restaurant has produced more money than Forrest Gump ever did And I was like that's interesting. He's like, why aren't there more of these? And so I kind of like this idea, which is basically you take IP intellectual property a brand from TV or movies and you license it So they did this for for Bubba Gump shrimp company And so what I went and kind of looked up the backstory of this and the backstory is pretty simple It's like The movie happens and Paramount is actually the one who did this and I thought I just kind of figured that Some entrepreneur went to them and got the brand actually was the opposite So from what I could read or whatever I found Paramount pictures goes and approaches this restaurant group called Rusty Pelican And they're like, hey, we want you to create a brand based off the brand of the movie because it's like a kind of a key plot point in the movie or whatever.

It's a key moment in the movie and It's some crazy things about this. So first they do that It it generates, you know, 200 million plus a year it gets it got bought by the Fertitta's I think And then their their restaurant group but it This is also where you know the actor Chris Pratt, of course He was a waiter at Bubba Gump shrimp company and this is how he got discovered. He was waiting on a table for this producer This is this director producer lady and he's like, oh, I love that thing you made and she's like, ah, that's great Well, blah, and they're talking and she's like, you know what like, you know, you want to be an actor He's like, yeah, that's what I'm just waiting tables.

I want to be an actor And that's how he got his break in the movie industry also. How did you learn about this? Just a hell of a lot of Google and my friend We don't all have buff researchers like Jake's almost got to get our hands dirty and go do some Google Let me tell you something really quick. So, you know, so you said the Fertitta's you met you were referring to the Fertitta brothers, right? So there's two brothers in Fertitta is the cousin. Yeah, so I think he's like a distance cousin So I was gonna I was gonna correct you but you you know the story but Tillman So there's this guy named Tillman Fertitta.

So a lot of people probably don't know this if you live in Houston If you live in Texas, you certainly know who this guy is. He's a pretty He's a pretty polarizing figure. I think a lot of people who know him think he's a huge asshole He probably he probably is an asshole. I mean, he's pretty cut through he owns this thing called Landry's Landry's I've never even been to one. I think that's its own restaurant. Yeah, it's a steakhouse. I think but then he also owns bubblegum shrimps He owns I believe like Jay Alexander's Ruth Chris steakhouse like a ton of like 30 to $50 ahead dinner places So like not particularly fancy but upscale really upscale upscale franchises and he owns about 600 of them But here's a fun fact.

I am pretty positive That Landry's is the largest company in America that is owned by one person Tillman Fertitta owns 100% of the business. He owns literally every single share Right around the beginning of COVID they were doing something like five billion in revenue and like 1.5 to 2 billion in EBITDA That's nuts. And by the way, he owns the Houston Rockets now So that's how that's why that's how he got a lot more famous was because when you buy the Rockets people want to know who the heck This guy is So that's kind of crazy.

Okay, so so so back to the kind of this idea real quick. So a Licensing IP so Doug was basically saying he's like, why don't more people do this? and he's like, why isn't there a paper company that's like the Dunder Mifflin paper company or You know, and so there's a couple of these so I went through and I kind of came up with a list of Brands that I think could translate here's what here's my list and then you tell me what you would do if you were approaching this Or if you think this is a bad idea, you can tell me I don't know.

It's a bad idea. That's for sure Here's my top five top five brands that I think you could license a credit company. So Dunder Mifflin paper company Yes, the office is one of the most popular shows of all time. It has like crazy reruns on Netflix And there's no signature paper companies. I look what what is another paper company? I have no idea So I think you'd stand out. All right, Duff beer from the Simpsons I think Duff beer could be a real beer. Maybe is a real beer somewhere But I think Duff beer is a potential one.

You don't have too many more You don't have another decade or two left with that one though Yeah, yeah, that one's sort of aging out Wonka bar so anything with Willy Wonka I think you could I think Willy Wonka painted this picture of like wonderment around the factory and this innovative stuff So I think you could take that brand and create cool novel like chocolates and candies out of it Another one is if you're an ad agency could you go and actually like franchise or license the Mad Men Brand for for that. So basically Sterling Cooper Draper or whatever it is.

Draper Price. So the name of their agency You know, why not why not use that if you're gonna start an ad agency versus anything else? And then I started thinking about all right, where else would I go for this and I think the opportunity here is like Depending on what age bracket you go for but I think the 90s had a bunch of Brands that were famous in the 90s for our age group if you're basically 30 or 40 right now There's a bunch of brands that have like zero kind of like equity value anymore But the brand names you grew up with it so you so it still means something to you And so we've talked about like warheads or Jinko jeans or no fear Yeah, like a bunch of these brands and I think the move here I think one interesting play here would be you don't actually have to create the product you could create So so another idea is to create the nostalgia licensing company and all it does is it goes and buys options on These brands and then it pedals them to existing makers of products and it's just says hey Why don't you use we have this portfolio of nostalgic brands? You could choose one of these that fits kind of your product category or whatever And you could just be the middleman basically you buy off by cheap options on these brands And then you sell them at a kind of a retail price if you can and even if you get one or two hits I think the business could be quite profitable.

So that's my random ass licensing idea I went to Urban Outfitters the other day because there's one near my house and they had they had you know Urban Outfitters is pretty shitty, but they have like tons of old t shirts and They it's like they're their whole genre of t shirts was things that 30 year olds saw their dad's wear and And it was like t shirts ahead like the old course light logo the old Budweiser logo I forget some of the other logos, but like I pretty remember blind skateboards or world industry skateboards or independent skater It kind of like transcended popular culture.

I thought but they had a lot of those things But anyway, I'm on board. That's amazing that public ump trip does that much revenue who and it's it's still owned by Landry's I guess but dude, it's a horrible restaurant. I'm amazed at that. It's like it's like an Applebee's Yeah, well, dude one of my first investors of any business I ever had was this guy who owned 12 Applebee's and this guy was like You know, I went to college at Duke and Durham, which is a pretty small city And this guy was like one of the wealthiest guys in Durham and how he owned like I got out of 10 to 20 Applebee's and I was like, oh you could just do that and he's like, yeah, here's how it works I was like, don't even tell me I I don't I want to be more successful than you But our I don't care if I'm less successful than you is what I mean I just don't want to own 20 Applebee's like that can't be the end game here I had a friend who worked on their ad agency or his ad agency won that account Happily's Applebee's and they gave him a thousand dollars to go spend at Applebee's and told him like to bring a friend and order Just a ton of stuff so you understand it and we ordered everything and I'm And I'm a slob I eat anything and I'll eat a ton of food like I'm six months of food Yeah, I'm an animal and he ordered we ordered so much stuff and I eat everything and anything And I got it in front of my plate and I was like you guys just microwave the steak Like this is microwave It was fucking awful All right, what what are you talking about a shit? Yeah What do you want to talk about about it? I just had one cool thing which was I don't know if you saw I tweeted this out yesterday But there's a video of Jeff Beza.

So I thought this billionaire going to space. It's like Elon's doing it and then you know Jeff Beza starts Blue Origin and Richard Branson has Virgin Galactic and it's sort of like, okay, cool Like this is you know golf for you know, old white billionaires basically it's like It's just a dick measuring contest is what it is. Yeah, it's a things wing and thing and so and so I was like, all right Well, I kind of wrote it off. I was like, you know, I think Elon was in it You know sort of first and genuinely for for much reasons That seemed real to me, but you know, definitely there's an ego component to it But what was cool was I found this interview with Jeff Bezos from the year 2000 so 21 years ago and Amazon at this time was like six years old.

So And there was definitely a thing but it wasn't Amazon like today It was like, you know, it was a public company, but it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't a juggernaut like it is now And I think they probably only had a couple of categories at that point There wasn't like prime and doing video and doing all this other stuff and he's sitting down and they're like, you know So, you know, what would you want to do? You know, what would you do if you could do anything? He's like if I could do anything and they're like, yeah, he's like, you know, I would love to explore space like space.

Yeah, I would love to just explore space and you know, he's like, you know the space and they're like, well Maybe you could do it someday. Yeah, you're a smart guy But if you put your mind to it, he's like, well, it's hard. It's really hard And like, but I think you could do it and he's like, yeah, you know, it's harder than you think like we haven't made much progress for space and like In the last 20 years, you know, but the technology is like he's like maybe 20 years from now the technology will be there or maybe we could we could do it and then 21 years sort of to the day He's in a spaceship going, you know in his own rocket company going into outer space So I thought that was pretty cool It made me give it had a different level of respect for it because it's more like somebody having a vision and a dream 20 years ago when it wasn't cool to talk about it or say it and then actualizing it not just sort of like copycatting Elon Yeah, so look, I think that it is like a like a like a measuring contest a pissing match But I'm all it and at first you're like, well, that's lame.

These guys are so rich. Why don't you do something good? But my opinion is this is good It's just so long term thinking that it's actually hard to see but I do think that we're gonna get good out of this And my opinion is when when rich people want to give money and they want shit named after them like a building like a hospital wing Or they want to go to space and make a big deal out of it And then like maybe in 10 years we can capture some of that value of like all right.

They kind of paved the way at First a lot of people are like, well, that's bullshit. You know fuck these guys But I'm like gives up fuck that's such that's the that's the most fair trade on earth We name this building after you and you give us all this money. Hey, I wrote your name on this. Yeah, it's thanks for the hundred mil Yes, it's like dude let them have that it cares if they have an ego like you get the money So like in my opinion, we should accept it as as good although sure Bezos said something Kind of stupid the other day, although I do like that.

He said it because it was kind of funny Yeah, but at the same time I'm like, oh you are asking for it so So Bezos flew up to space with his brother and this older woman I forget her name and a young kid. I believe there was supposed to be another person on there But he had a scheduling conflict I swear to God. Don't be that guy. Yeah, there was supposed to be someone else and there was a scheduling conflict so the guy couldn't make it and they go to space and They're up there throwing skittles at each other's face.

Did you see that they're like doing flip Bezos is like he goes hey guys I brought skittles and he brings out a packet of skittles and he the key throws a skittle at one person He goes and the guy catches it in your mouth And Jeff goes let me try and Jeff hands the kid the bag of skittles He goes throw one in my mouth and I thought that was amazing amazing for skittles. I'm surprised. He's not like hey I have Amazon sugar circles. Yeah, you know, I'm throwing at each other, you know like our own house brand So I thought that was kind of cute and funny and he lands and he says I just want to thank all of you workers at Amazon as well as all you customers because you paid for this He said that and I was like, oh That's not the best way to phrase that then this morning.

I shared this with you I saw a business insider article which I think is I kind of love them But at the same time I I can't stand some of those things they write But Jeff Bezos was actually an early investor in business insider and the business insider article Was written in such a way that it's it was complaining about it and it said Bezos's flight to space was too cramped and far too short Oh my god, and I was like, oh my god, you're complaining like I'm what you just said that was amazing. First of all the couple thoughts on what you just said I Hate the haters Okay, first of all Dan just looked it up the person who had the scheduling conflict paid 28 million for their seat So that's kind of insane.

I think their dad paid for their seat or something Look up the story Dan. Tell me what what I'm missing here cuz Wow, you know If you're gonna hate someone don't hate the billionaire who built Amazon and then Reinvested his money into like exploring outer space hate the trust fund kid who paid 28 million for his ticket and then and then no Showed because he you know was doing a tick tock dance or something. I don't know who I don't know the story behind this But that's kind of ridiculous the I'm so tired of people just like hating billionaires randomly.

I'm team billionaire is what I'm trying to say You know people are so dumb. They're like, why are you wasting money on this? You know when they like do this like when you pay for when you when you fund a space company You're paying, you know, Pete that money doesn't just like go into space and just vanish Yeah, I think it's a blort and has like 3,000 employees. I think yeah when he spends the money It's going into people's pockets. And so it's funding jobs funding, you know Explorer technology development and a lot of great technology We have came because of what NASA did for the space program And so, you know, one of the silliest things is thinking that the money just somehow gets vacuumed into outer space the second thing is Just don't be that guy.

It's not even that I'm team billionaire I'm team not the guy who's hating on billionaires all the time This happened actually a second ago that Clubhouse tweeted out. Oh Like we are open for everybody now. There's no wait list or something like that We got a new logo and all the stuff and you know, I'm obviously not you know, the clubhouse cheerleader, right? So so don't get me wrong, but the very first comment the top comment is Open for everybody, but you don't even have captions on the live audio So it's not open for deaf people and I'm like, okay like, you know fair point that it's you know, not doesn't have like full accessibility, but like That's the top comment.

That's the first comment like this company has to provide you live audio text captioning Otherwise like fuck them. I guess just that hater culture is so annoying to me And it's so weak and spineless to be just like a you know, like the top comment just like oh, yeah You did this great thing, but you know, but whatever and I know that's gonna sound hypocritical because I wrote kind of like a giant thread Hating on Clubhouse Well, it wasn't exactly hating but that's gonna be the easy criticism. I wasn't trying to hate I was basically saying what I think some of the like why I think they're not gonna why it's not gonna work out the way They think some of the like strategic product problems.

I just wrapped it in a funny even though you explicitly said I hope none of this comes true Yeah, I wanted to win. I think it's cool when things win, but like, you know, I think people are missing the boat Anyways, I guess I'm just over hater culture and the easiest way to find it is go read any like response to anything that Elon or Jeff Bezos or these people like people who are doing great things in the world and have won the game You know the money game They attract this like really annoying class of haters and I actually think you should rephrase it I'm not team billionaire.

What I'm team is I'm on team people who who set audacious goals and get after it I want to do your thing. Yeah Do your thing and let me let you do your thing. I'm gonna do my thing. Why do I need to worry about your thing? Yeah, I have respect for someone who says they're gonna write a book this year And they write a book or someone who says they're gonna lose 50 pounds and they lose 50 pounds I'm on team you set what you're gonna do and you actually achieve it and it just so happens that one of the big outputs of Business is money and that's a great way to measure it.

But when I look at something like Sean Parker before he got involved with Facebook and before he actually became wealthy Sean Parker started Napster Napster a lot of people Well, and it probably was the case it was unethical and he actually it was a he did not succeed financially because of it I've always admired that because it was an 18 year old who just Revolutionized something and totally caused a shit storm and gotten the thick of it and made something interesting And so I'm in favor of people who do that and oftentimes those are people who build a hundred thousand person company called Amazon, but Yeah, so I would actually say if you are a billionaire hater out there I think you should actually rephrase it I mean there are people who are billionaires that I think are fucking awful people and I and I don't want them to exist But I enjoy seeing people who put their their stamp on the world And I think that's what we should celebrate not just defaulting to hate the way some people do Yeah, or you know it just in general like how somebody else spends their money.

That's there That's their that's their business, right? Like I think Elon right now is living in like a 50 square foot like pop up house or something you've seen this He's living in like a shipping container or something. He sold his house. He sold his cars he's living in a goddamn like 50 square foot shipping container and Uses all you know, he put his entire like he whatever he made out of zip He put all he poured it all in went into debt to try to make Tesla and SpaceX happen and like when they win You know he gets rewarded for it But even if he decided to do nothing and never work again and just wanted mansions and butlers cool That's is your money do your thing Decisely, you know Criticizing other people for how they spend their money it really all that says I wouldn't spend my money that way And I think that's a fair thing to say But I think in most cases the people who are doing this they would do they would spend their money You know in the same ways or worse and for the record if I could if I could trade spots with the Elon Musk If someone said you could trade spots automatically and by the way, you'll still be the same age that you are I Wouldn't I wouldn't do it.

Yeah, not a million years when I trade spots with that guy I think it's awesome what he's doing for him good. Do your thing. All right Here's something at the opposite end of the spectrum. Have you ever heard of bills lemonade? No All right, so go to this website. Just type in bills lemonade. This is a little fascinating business a friend kind of tip me off to this and I can't say their name because I don't know if they want their name said but basically this is this is a Builden tell me this is like a business in a box and this business does about five million a year Roughly and what they do is they just sell you a kind of like a course and the materials to start your own lemonade stand Not for kids But for like adults like you could start this outside of a of a concert venue or a ballgame or like at your like Local like neighborhood square or whatever and what they do is they basically say hey You can you can here's a business in a box If you have the ability to grab this bottle and shake it you can become a lemonade stand owner and you can make this much money Here's how it works that you can download there like a little brochure which shows the unit economics It's like every lemonade cost a dollar twenty to make that's your cost and you're gonna sell that for you know $4 $5 $6 depending on your location So you're gonna have you know 70% margins on this thing and if you could sell X many per day You're gonna make this much money and they basically just sell you this business in a box It's a very simple business and bills lemonade on the other side.

They don't take any royalties or franchise fees They say you're gonna get our brand We're gonna send or send you the machine the frozen, you know lemonade machine or the shakers the the cups the everything and All you do is you pay for the materials and the like information the course on how to do it and I just thought this is kind of a Fascinating idea and I feel like you can do this for a whole bunch of other a whole bunch of other like industries as well like whether it's you know, snow cones or ice cream trucks or Pest control or something like that like I just feel like there's a whole bunch of business in a box as you could make And if you did that, maybe you could even roll these up into one thing which is like hey, you don't want a job You want your own business is gonna get you a hundred thousand dollars a year and you'll be able to kind of control the hours You work and you're gonna work for yourself Are there people out there who want that trade as a franchisee? Yes, and then basically you just say great Would you like the lemonade one? Would you like to run drive an ice cream truck? Would you like to do this or that and we own all these brands? It's sort of like what 1 a hundred got junk has where they have the The trucks you can drive the franchise you could buy to be a junk hauler or the house painter or that I forgot They have like three or four of them But I feel like you could create a mini version of what a hundred got junk with this dude.

This is awesome I'm looking at this and I'm trying to find There was a guy when I started my hot dog stand There was a guy in Tennessee who is doing this exact same things for hot dog stand So you'd give him five grand and he would send you everything you needed along with the state rules and things like that I need it for hot dog stands bill some an a's is better because you could spend Fit I don't even know what the price is like a couple hundred dollars on here and I'm looking at it now This is pretty badass you And these guys have been doing this forever by the way, I'm looking at their website I've seen this brand a long time ago.

Yeah This is badass and they just have like you can buy all your supplies from there. I recognize these cups too by the way Right. I've seen this like I think at baseball games or something but yeah, so I think this is kind of interesting another version of this I think you could do is in the services industry and So like here's like another one which is like let's say Corporate headshots, so I once saw Facebook ads at the profile picture I have for this podcast this like kind of like where I'm trying to make this like ominous look it's because I saw a Facebook ad of a really high quality headshot and Like a striking headshot and it was like I can make I could take a photo of you that will look like this Like you can level up your kind of like game as far as your brand your LinkedIn your website whatever it is You know, it's 300 bucks and like I shoot in you know in the Bay Area And I'll come do it a shoot for you and you get to pick your photos wherever and I just remember thinking Oh, that's really smart like I never seen Facebook ads This is somebody if I never seen a photographer doing Facebook ads for this But I feel like you could do the same thing here where you could basically sell somebody a business in a box that says hey Maybe maybe photos a little too high skill, but you could say like any kind of like service and you could say great You're gonna be the service provider in your local area And I'm gonna run the Facebook ads countrywide and then whenever there's a lead for your area I'm just gonna dispatch it to you and you just go fulfill it and it's a business in a box that way great You wear you wear our uniform, you know, you could do geek squad this way like tech help or something like that You could do it for the thing we talked about with like setting up home Home office and home office video studios what I would do is I would do it for taking so when we were when I rented out my place So I took pictures and I put it online and I didn't get that much love and then I went online And I found a photographer to come and take pictures for me and I paid her $200 and I got way more traction and my wife works at Airbnb and I think she has told me I don't remember if Who told me I think it was her that told me that the number one Difference between a winning Airbnb and a losing Airbnb is the pictures and yeah I definitely think you could have Airbnb photos comm or whatever it is and that and you take $25 for every lead that you send a Photographer and you could totally crush it that way right? So I like these little business of the box ideas.

This is like, you know, the opposite of the billionaire space race. This is the Bill's lemonade making $5 million selling lemonade kits to people which is cool. There's this company called iCRACT I got a lot of money from the company There's this company called iCRACT iCRACT was started by a friend of mine a j4 sith it went out either it was acquired But I don't think they even kept the brain anymore and what they did was they actually raised like 20 million or 30 million dollars from adresin Horowitz and what iCRACT did was they were doing this for iPhone repair And so I guess to switch an iPhone screen on your phone It takes only like a few hours of training Anyone could figure it out if I just showed you how to do it and what they would do is they would send you leads and they would Take a small cut of the charge so they would charge like $150 to fix your phone And maybe they would take $20 then in order to get leads from them You had to buy iPhone parts from them and they would sell you iPhone parts and they're doing something like $30 million a year in ecom sales.

I don't know how much service revenue they're making but just selling right screens They're doing like 20 or 30 million dollars in sales for the service Yeah, that's crazy. Oh, what do you think went wrong with the business? Uh, I think they raised too much money and probably spent way too much money on ads. I'm not sure if it was quite venture scale They got to like 20 or 30 million in sales And I don't know if they could figure out how to get bigger than that and they try to launch more stuff and probably lost focus You gotcha There's other services out there that are just like them that do like 30 40 50 million dollars a year in revenue Also AJ my friend who's the founder He's a wild man and I think that he had like crazy aspirations of like having a drone come and drop off stuff Like things like that and I don't know if that industry is cut out for that But I do think you could have a nice company that makes 30 40 in sales on this episode of visionaries gone wrong He had a healthy business and wanted to change it having drones drop off your iPhone.

Yeah He was also the one who like paddleboards to work every day or something, right? Like doesn't he do something crazy like that? Yeah, he had a small little dingy boat like a little tiny boat I forget what they called it, but it was it was it's super small like the small like the size of like a little baby Desk but had like an engine on it and he would ride that from where's the Oracle office out there? Like 20 minutes away, I forget in California, but he would write it down the bay to his office at South Park in Soma Yeah, I think that's awesome.

It sounds like a super interesting guy. I love it. Yeah, he's crazy All right, so do we're gonna get to the episode or the yeah, let's do the interview now All right, so you're gonna hear Andrew and let us know what you think Andrew. So how do you pronounce your last name? gas Deckey my friends coming gas gas. All right. Go ahead Sean. Sorry. I never had a Cool nickname or friends for that matter, but all right. So you did that you did your like microquire Funding announcement thing yesterday. I'm curious does that do anything? So, you know, we're seeing this a lot more where it's like all the famous people on Twitter and tech like did something They also promoting something me and Sam have been a part of a few of these What's the result is that like meaningful or is it just like a feel good moment or does it do anything for you? Yeah, that's a good question.

I would I would say both. I mean Really, you know, the goal of that fundraise was I want to build microquire with a startup community And so just having everyone involved in that for feedback and just you know, really letting everybody know that this is kind of You know something to watch So good brand value added and then yeah, we saw like 2.5 million impressions on Twitter So for those listening microquire, so Andrew, you've had a couple companies You sold one recently or like a couple years ago, which was sounds like a home run for you But microquire although you guys have some really big aspirations right now if we had to like Kind of dumb it down.

It's a newsletter that people pay to get access to and that Content is interesting startups that you vetted and are now for sale. That's like the current iteration, right? Well, it's not just a newsletter, right? Like I go to the website I don't get I don't even look at the news there. It's so it's a market. It's like a marketplace It's like if you want to go buy a house you go to Zillow you see a bunch of houses for sale. I only read the newsletter Okay, who's who's the normal user is it Sam or me? It sounds like you Sean.

So it's a marketplace. So you can sign up create a profile list your startup in You know literally minutes Then I have a team on the back end that basically creates like a sim I'm completely free. We have a streamlined process that does that and then once you go live on for people who don't know It's basically a document that outlines basic details that buyers would want to know like revenue How much time are you spending on customer support? What is the tech stack who your competitors? Why are you selling asking price market opportunity? just basically a pitch deck but more geared towards like I'm selling the business and And After you go live on microquire you thousand Dollars worth of subscribers.

So they pay like two hundred ninety nine dollars a year, right? Yeah, two ninety we're at like six seventy five Thousand okay, and so the I mean you have this grand vision here, but in doing this you I mean there's a What did you describe it? Did you say Zillow for startups? Is that how you described it once? Is it a low for M&A? Basically what we want to know does it? Yeah, so what we want to build is we want to build a global and modern M&A marketplace right now the whole M&A marketplace is fragmented and we're looking to consolidate it and really bring in Everyone who's involved in M&A transactions like when you get on the larger side Now you have investment bankers you have an M&A advisor on the lower end you have business brokers even just people for due diligence or accounting or You know potential wealth management if you're successful in your acquisition So we're going to be really building a community of advisors as startups can hire But then on top of that we're going to build tools to make acquisitions super easy We we bought a business for somebody on here.

So we did a what we called a micro spec which is basically Your idea Andrew you basically tweeted at me or something like that and we're and I was like this is a great idea what we did was we said hey, let's put up five grand and Into a holding of blank shell companies that would put give five grand to an entrepreneur and then we'll find them a business to buy On micro acquire will go vet 50 deals 100 deals and we'll go find a business for them to buy We'll go buy a micro business and the other people out That was such a cool idea that somebody was like, oh, I'm in for five.

I'm in for five I'm in for five and all of a sudden we had a hundred grand. I think the total amount was like 85 to 100 grand that we ended up raising from random people on Twitter To help this entrepreneur Daniel buy his first business and so like he was gonna go get a job and then it's like okay instead You can you can buy this Shopify app. That's producing revenue. That's profitable today And and let's go go buy this thing and so that's what we ended up doing which I think is pretty cool And that experiment is is still running so the transaction closed.

He's Figuring out ways to grow it. He's sending his little like investor updates. It's awesome And I feel I called it at the time I said this is like when you go to buy like cake mix and it's like just add water This is a like just add hustle. Well, here's a business It's here's the codes already written the business already running the revenues already there And all you need to do is grow it and then you just need to add that hustle into to grow this thing Yeah, and we did we actually did one with the hustle and we gave enough we did the same thing I don't remember who came first, but we did the same thing And the guy who won it is a dentist here in New York and he's offering to give me free braces as a thank you Yeah, I'm still working with him on finding a business.

He's um, he's being pretty picky, but we'll get we'll get something good But um, yeah, he was like what a commit for a teeth cleaning retainer braces. Let me know I would love to thank you. He He's awesome. We've been chatting Almost weekly just going over businesses. He's interested in I get my opinion and most of them are like no that one's like Too complex or something like that But Sean I want to talk about that that deal that we did you have no fucking idea how much work that was like I Literally had to get no rise 50 emails come through a dude.

We did it legit like Like, you know, we formed a new ink So a new corporation to purchase and transfer the assets into We you know created stock agreements for 20 plus investors So this was harder than the fund raise that I I just did by a mile and It took like three weeks the legal bill for me was like 15k and I spent like 60 fucking hours. It was totally worth it Um Dan is amazing. I meet with Dan Sounds like it might not be worth it. Well, well, here's the thing is it opened my eyes to a new opportunity for microquire as well Which is there's all these amazing operators that don't have capital But again, there's so many businesses on microquire that you know, they're built by builders They aren't looking to scale a business.

They're not familiar with sales and marketing And so we see an opportunity to potentially allow them to raise capital from other investors Just like we did with Dan like a micro spack. Spacks are kind of getting a bad name. So we might need to rebrand on that But yeah So like if you if you're like you own an agency and you see a product for two million bucks And you have tens of thousands of customers you can easily sell this product to we allow you to basically Present that to other investors inside microquire and this is just like a napkin idea This isn't like a guaranteed thing But streamlining that whole process that we went through Sean like that I think could be a really really interesting opportunity and we're thinking about that a little bit by the way The thing you're describing is like it's basically what Angelus did so Angelus was like great.

We're a marketplace to connect Startups and investors and they started by doing that and then they were like, okay, cool What else can we do? Well startups need employees. So we'll create a jobs division and then they're like, well Some of these entrepreneurs want to be investors But they're not investors. They don't have the ability to raise capital, you know, it's very hard to raise a fund Okay, we'll create like rolling funds and we'll create spvs It will create one click ways for now you to invest and instead of just being an entrepreneur And so they created what's called a market network, which is basically People have heard of a network network just a bunch of like let's say let's say there's 10 dots on the screen and they're connected by like little lines that's a network and All the dots do their own thing and a market network is where it's 10 dots on a screen and there's lines connecting all of them But there's money signs going in between each right? So like on Facebook you transfer likes to each other you transfer comments to each other messages But on Angelus when you hire someone for a job, you give them money when you invest in somebody you give them money when you Raise money from for your rolling fund somebody's giving you money And so there's every transaction instead of just being a message is money And so if you've never heard this concept before It's pretty important one and in terms of business go research market networks James Currier and the NFX team Write a lot about this.

They're kind of the only ones I see writing about this But I think it's a pretty important idea and then once you know Oh, there's such a thing as a market network Then when you see a business that structure as a market network, you know It's a good opportunity either to start it or to invest in it That's why I invest in microquire because I was like, oh, this is a this is a market network great I've been looking for market networks to invest in this is a good one Yeah, so I just wanted to kind of like throw that little theory And if nobody knows that that term and one of the reasons why we wanted you to come on Andrew was I want to hear about the micro acquire story, but I want to hear particularly two things in this order the first is Yeah, I want you to go through some of the coolest Startups that you have sold or are selling on the platform some of the insights that you've gotten from them and and and things like that and then also what we should talk about at the end is You sold your last company for like 20 maybe 30 or 40 million dollars I forget the exact amount like a pretty significant amount and life changing them out and you you Told me some crazy stuff that you do with the money.

I would definitely want to talk about that But can we start with that one? I want to hear that. Yeah. Yeah So before micro car you start a company you sell it for ballpark ish give me a range Rhymes with 30 million Let's just assume I have you know low eight figures I I candidly don't like to specifically say how much I sold my company for I think it's a weird flex and it's Hard to do without feeling like you're bragging. So let's just peg it at low eight figures But yeah, the story there I started a company in college.

I was 21. It was a no code app builder So it was a SaaS company Only raised a hundred thousand dollars for that business ran it for about eight years grew it to over 10 million and recurring revenue employees was over a hundred There was a lot of Moving parts that business We love those people overseas Yeah, so you have a hundred employees or you won't make a lot of profit in your underpaying people Yeah, so it was it was a mixture of both not underpaying people, but we probably have the team was in house.

So our entire engineering team is probably overseas But the way it started was again, I'm not a technical founder at all I don't know how to write code at all and when I tell people that they they're kind of like wait What? But I was in Chico and there's no engineers in Chico, but I just went on up work I Previously had a job board before that that I also sold and that was a seed money for business apps But found just randomly found an engineer in China His name is Raymond Chester. I'm still friends with him today and he was just a badass like he could have been a CTO at a Silicon Valley company and I paid him well treated him well and consider him like a brother and Considering I didn't know how to hire other engineers or spot good engineers I knew how to manage and that's one tip for people that aren't technical is You know, I always recommend don't learn how to code learn how to manage Engineers properly and so I ended up just hiring all the friends.

So we ended up having like a house for them and they had like 20 engineers in China and we had engineers in Russia we had one and we had a group we had a QA team in the Ukraine So you big communist fan I guess you could say so I mean not not by design but you know, we we did not discriminate Yeah, what is your customer service based out of Cuba or what? No, no, so customer service was in house, but we did have 24 seven customer service. So we had some customer support reps in Brazil, France Some other some other areas but Let's fast forward to the good bits.

So you You build the business and it's good 10 million in recurring revenue You decide to sell it. Why did you decide to sell it and then how did you sell it? So I was so initially I I tried selling it when I was 26. I hired an investment bank and This kind of leads into micro far as well. We did, you know, full road show ended up getting an offer for 30 million ended up turn turning down that offer. We also had an offer from a strategic company One of the you know big do yourself website companies.

You could probably guess it. I was using the I felt I still had gas in the tank and so I wanted to push for, you know, a larger exit after we went through that process Just kept running the business kept growing the business kept staying focused on executing which is the number one way to really Sell a business is having good business. So went back to, you know, executing with my team and then Just started getting tired. That's the short answer. I just you know managing them and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you Managing that many people Monday comes around.

It's like, hey, can we talk? It's like I get it. Like you want to Switch jobs like please just you can just email me. Like I'll write your reference. Like I love you Please I don't need to hear like, you know, we're good or like I'm sick, you know It just became so much management and I love, you know building businesses and the ideation stage the way the transaction went down was The private equity firm ESW capital had previously reached out to us I think it was like five years ago or something like that like prior to the investment bank And I know this because during due diligence We had to share all the NDA's that we had signed and I found them from ESW capital.

I was like, oh We met before nice to meet you again. Uh You know, let's uh, let's see if we can make this happen They gave me fantastic terms. It was an all cash transaction. Uh, we did a stock purchase So I benefited from QSBS, which if you're looking to sell a business look up QSBS You pay zero federal taxes on up to the first 10 million. So I save I don't know what I saved. I gotta ask my accountant, but I actually didn't even know about QSBS until I If you're I had QSBS if you're in California It's uh about 15 percent.

So 15 percent on 10 million you save $1.5 million or it might be even a little bit more But around one and a half million dollars in savings. No, it's actually 20 I think it's more than that. It's the federal idea. So I saved like two million on taxes and I paid 13 state Well, yeah, you're my bad. I I'm an idiot. I totally I picked the wrong the wrong one I forgive you Sean. I I'm calling you the wrong name on purpose man because you I'm calling you the wrong name on purpose man because you put your my name There was levels to that job got you back got you back.

Um, but anyways, um, so we structured a really favorable deal for me. So we had two million cash on hand, which we added onto the purchase price So we had an agreed purchase price and I said I want a stock deal Um, no earn out. I'd love for you to buy the cash and the reason for buying the cash as they buy it Basically, they just put a one X multiple onto the purchase price. And so typically if you are acquired You have two million cash on the bank account that is dividend back out to shareholders and your your tax debt 40% so we got QSBS on that two million cash Um quick transition in terms of me leaving the business.

So I was out of the business in 90 days That's great. And what'd you do? Uh, you said, you know, you bought a house What what's the mindset because so you go from basically Before that how much money did you have because you were just paying yourself a salary out of the business, right? Like you didn't it's not like you had you were at serious selling tv So it's not like you had a bunch of money before that you're running the business. You probably were paying yourself some salary But probably nothing fancy and then all of a sudden you come into a bunch of money.

So describe that transition and what you did What you did with it? Yeah, so I I was okay before The acquisition I I was buying ethereum at like 20 I remember like the day ethereum came on a coinbase and the etf was coming out like approval denial Now I was like bitcoin's going down. Let's just move it in this new thing called ethereum. So I bought a bunch of ethereum. So I had like let's just call it like, you know high six figures So I wasn't like paying debt, you know as soon as we got acquired but Right when you go through an acquisition, you have a closing date and we had a circle closing date And then all of a sudden there's gigantic Amount of money just hits your bank account and you're like what the fuck did I just do that was my feeling I was I was actually kind of scared I was like Is this legal like did I just sell drugs? Like yeah Like you know some people like think like you just celebrate and you're like like I I made it like yes I was like the opposite.

I was like, you know, candidly. I was like chain smoking like a jewel. I was like Oh, holy shit. This is insane, you know, because you know, I grew up poor like, you know, my dad died when I was six I grew up in Detroit. I moved to San Clemente when I was, you know, like Five I grew up knowing like what it's like to like really struggle for money So going from like that to like an absorbent amount where you know, I'm not fine private Or anything like that like I'm not like balling like some of the other people you guys talked to but I'm comfortable like I was set like I can literally buy a house cash I could you know, put money into something really boring and just you know, watch it grow over time So it just it was a life changing moment.

But my reaction was Holy shit This is insane And I hope you know, they don't come back and say hey We found something wrong and we do it. Yeah And the business when I did my deal when we did my deal I remember I called the bank ahead of time and I let them know I'm like There's gonna be like a big deposit and I don't want you to think that like I'm doing something illegal Like is there like a check mark you need to put next to this like I called you I told you like this is normal And they're like no like it's fine and they're like How much do you expect to come in and I remember being on the phone? I like I whispered it I was like I didn't want anyone to be here.

I'm like It's like uh around this number and they're like I can't hear you and I and I remember saying it again and I had a and I whispered a little bit more and And and I it was uncomfortable. I was like this is kind of weird Saying this and they're like, yeah, that shouldn't be a problem at all and I'm like Well, you you don't sound impressed like Sam I I did this thing for a minute So the first the first thing I did was um, I hired a wealth manager to move all the money out of uh My bank account.

He just bought bonds. I knew nothing about bonds and then all of a sudden I'm like, why is there more money? And they're like, yeah, that's how bonds used to work at least Um, but when I went into wire the money So my office was in La Jolla in San Diego. It's kind of like the Beverly Hills of San Diego Um, the guy was like, this is the biggest wire I have ever done Like can we triple triple triple triple quadruple check this And I was like really like La Jolla like there's like 10 million dollar houses everywhere.

It's like, yeah, this is the biggest one Like I'm nervous And so we wired that over it's a lot of money But what I used to do I was I was just gonna say one other funny thing I do I would go in I this is kind of like a like a lame move But I used to go into the bank a few times before that wire And I'd pull out like a 20 dollar bill. I'd be like, hey, can I get like 20 bucks out just so they can see my account? like Like, yeah, I just need 20 bucks and then they look they and I come in looking like this I'm like 29 because I was 29 when I sold the business.

So Like, you know, I'm gonna do some immature stuff. Like I'm not gonna be a professional like, you know, and I You know, I hadn't been married. I didn't have a kid at the time. So, you know It was party time at that at that moment. Um, so yeah, I'd go into the bank and be like, hey Yeah, I was gonna say I was gonna say similarly we had this guy James Hong who created hot or not on the podcast He said the same thing he goes I used to go to an ATM machine and just put my card in and say print balance And just look at it.

He's like, I would just do that like every day for like the first like in a week that it that had happened And just he just wanted to print out the balance on his little paper rip it up and then like go about his day He just made him happy. So on this podcast, we've had a lot of really what we've had a lot of really successful people We've had some people who have sold things for over a billion dollars. We've had people who have sold things for hundreds of millions of dollars We've had people who have raised hundreds of millions of dollars.

This is all a huge amount of money But I have found myself when we talked to these incredibly we just had darmash on the podcast and I was like darmash Isn't it crazy? I could see your like your hub spot shares, you know, right now you're worth like 900 million dollars. That's wild and um, so you kind of like get in this bubble of like, oh, yeah, it's like, you know, uh 20 10 million whatever 30 million whatever the numbers are we're like, oh, that's like, you know, that's a nice start, you know But then like when you think about one person having that amount of money particularly when they're young when they're 29 um, that's a that's a that I ran the mathy or they had a friend that sold his company and he's uh, 32 now and he's got over 50 million dollars liquid And I was like, dude, this is crazy that you have this and we did some research and we found out that there's like 600 americans Uh who have that much money or more who are also in around that same age It's like dude, that's crazy.

You're like one of the you know, almost top 500 richest young people in america That's an astounding amount of money and that's kind of like what you had andrew It's an astounding thing and you talk about like well, I can't play private Uh, you can't play private, but it's like, yeah, yeah, you can you really can I mean you're like incredibly wealthy If you have that amount of money at that young of an age the age factors are really big deal here I I I agree because I mean so moving in do you guys want to hear what I bought? I told you a chair so the first thing my friends call me kind of like um Like like a white rapper kind of guy like I love hip hop like I love fast cars.

I love big houses Yeah, detroit man. If it wasn't m&m and be me, um So I bought a big ass house cash 2.5 million San Mateo around the golf course I see like literally deers running around in my backyard um And I recommended that to you sam because it's like it's you work so hard and when you come from nothing Just having I wanted something that I could just be proud of like you come over and you're like Damn, you don't get this with a regular job and I'm like, yeah, you don't you need to start a business And I'm happy to talk to you about that because that's like all I talk about is startups and stuff like that um, and then also for my wife just for you know, supporting me through the years and you know, we wanted to start a family so um bought a beautiful home Uh, and then I bought a A 663 AMG like you sam, but I bought a older one for the yeah bad ass car For the naturally aspirated.

It was my second one Um, I wanted just like a newer one with less miles Um, and that's that's all I bought. Um That's that's pretty legit just and then I put the rest into Uh, just like really boring index funds like vanguard dimensional. Um, I don't I barely angel best I'm in so I did the exact I do the same thing and Sam are the same Dude, I did the exact thing to do when you get rich. Yes. I got a black Mercedes black AMG Mercedes I think technically mine is faster than yours. Just say it is but I looked I looked it up.

Oh my god But they're both cool. They're both cool. I got a house I didn't get nearly as fancy but a nice house and then I also put almost every single thing into a vanguard total market index fund and Sean and a few other people just Merciously like kind of kind of mocked me like if they don't mock me I Sean kind of rolls his eyes He's like, why aren't you taking risks? And I'm like, I don't know. This seems pretty risky. So you and I are the same Uh, same type of thing. I don't know why Sean and all these guys we hang out with I don't know why they like buy stocks all the time I'm like, what are you doing? Like what I don't even know how to like what do you mean? You do it's fun.

It's the real world casino. Uh, you know, like whatever You gotta have some fun with it I've never sold a stock and I and these guys are doing it like every day sharing their screenshots and I'm like, you're nuts I think that's nutty I guess I guess my view is like What what what more money do you need? Like the way I view it and if you do the math like, you know 10 percent market returns compounded for 40 years sell when you're seven you're set like you're gonna be balling when you're seven you're gonna be Like rich is like like you're gonna die with that money.

And so Like for me, I don't like checking the stock market. I don't care to I don't want to understand it Um, I no longer own any bitcoin or ethereum Like I have the most boring investment strategy. So people listening to this that are like In real estate or you know stocks or probably like this kid's an idiot But I like waking up without any money problems. I don't have a mortgage I don't care if my stock portfolio goes down. Like it's just there till I'm 70. It's a set plan I'm not deviating from it But I guess for me money buys like just peace of mind like I just I have no worries and so You know tying me in the microquire.

It's like I'm comfortable taking big swings because you know, I have a wind under my belt Um comfortable with everything I have Um, I have no material wants outside the lambini Uh, urus, I'd take that if I could afford it or actually get it approved by my wife. Um, who's uh, very Very, uh, cost, uh, conscious Italian. Um But other than that, I mean, you know, just love building businesses and that's all I focus on and that's I think that's the key Sam is like, you know, when you go boring It allows you to focus on what you're really really good at rather than trying to like manage stocks like investing in startups Like what's crypto doing today? Like who's this new? I don't know.

Whatever. Yeah, it's like zuckerberg Zuckerberg wearing the same gray shirt every day. He just removed one whole thing He needs to think about which is like fashion how I look what I'm gonna wear How I'm gonna dress that day and just let his brain focus on the one thing he wants it to focus on that day Um So I wanted to ask you I want to wrap this up because uh, we're gonna basically use this as like kind of half the episode than half the episode It's going to be a different riff, but I wanted to ask you because you're seeing a bunch of businesses on microchip every day what um You know, this is the podcast of business ideas.

What ideas or niches or spaces are you seeing interesting things? Give us two or three Ideas that people should be looking at or spaces that people could be building in that you see opportunity Um that you would do if you were kind of like, you know, 22 again or whatever Yeah, definitely. Well first I'm going to take the cop out answer and I would start with something you're passionate in I think that's huge. Like if you're not passionate about it. There's someone who is and they're gonna just Beat you but I think what's really opened my eyes about micro require every day.

I wake up and I get to see the most interesting startups I was telling um Someone earlier today like there was a rabbit breeding company for farmers to track like when they make Other rabbits or something like that make like a million a year or something like that Like super niche and profitable and I'm like and it's a SaaS business. It's legit Um, probably not like the bet. I would not recommend buying that business. It's not for me But it just is an example of just how broad I think the future of of the small business economy is going to be online digital and profitable People who used to want to start like a restaurant or like a plumbing business or something like that Those young entrepreneurs are going to be looking to start a niche SaaS company or a niche ecommerce company Like categories that we see a lot of activity in our obviously Shopify SaaS applications Um lots of communities even newsletters um, like kind of everything online and like it goes as deep as like we sold this company That was a marking automation platform for just specific types of dentists and they were making an absorbent amount of profit Sold within like a couple weeks, but that's kind of where I think things are going is we're gonna have a few Really really large companies, you know ventures going into Tons of tons of different companies and we're going to see just probably a handful of winners is my guess And then we're going to see a long tail and the tan calculating that someone put this out where Um, you know, you have a 2.5

chance of becoming a unicorn when you raise venture capital So those are my odds. I'd probably increase it to 20 just with my my my luck. My friends call me gaz luck Um, that's another nickname I have Um, but for the other 97.5 there's microquire, you know, if you build a business and you know, you want to sell for You know a small but life changing amount. You're not getting a tech crunch. You can do that, but yeah trends just Very very niche very very focused I think is the key and those are the businesses I get most excited about and then if you're looking to buy a business There's a ton that just are built by really really talented engineers great for acquires I'm seeing tons of those And then also for people that are experienced in sales and marketing want to just like we did with dan shon Or we just let's hustle on the same try to grow it.

That's also a huge opportunity. Let's name a few specific ones You have this one started by this guy named arson nermago made off. I know how to say a less name because It could be could be could be nermago made off. I didn't realize that that was a common last name Um, but so this is a b2b. So or can you actually talk about this? I'm looking at the email a b2b software company corporate gifting I don't even know what that is 20 million in arr 3 million in profit it looks like right am I reading this right? Yep.

Yeah, so all those are private so I can't name the names the one that what you're viewing at the top is a podcast that I did so Um arson sold rest packed for half a million on microquire in about a month I believe it was like a developer api tool. There's over a thousand plus startups on microquire right now. So I I don't have my I'm not that smart. My memory is not that good, but uh, keep going. Yeah, no Oh, uh, I'm looking at one of the ones you had listed here on this idea sheet I guess so that one wasn't one that you sold So I just want to hear about a specific one a few specific ones that you've sold as well as like Maybe a few specific ones where you saw this and you're like, oh my gosh I could have I should have started this company or like this is amazing If people knew that these types of things they existed they would totally be starting things like this Okay, so I'll talk about the ones that I know I have permission to talk about one.

Um, was a company called Uh push engage it sold to um an individual named sied. He runs a firm called also motive And he basically is doing a wordpress type roll up and he looks for yeah We've talked about we've talked about wp beginner on here a bunch So sied awesome guy that acquisition was in the seven figures that one closes in like sied me fast. I want to close in like Two weeks or something that I don't know the exact details, but Um, the founder was happy sied was happy um, another one would be median which sold for Uh, a quarter million 300 I don't know the exact amount off the top of my head, but it's basically like a live chat video tool So if you log on to a website instead of going to like crisp chat like this intercom button I'm seeing right here You can just click it and then like my video pops up and you're like hey like And then I can take control of your this was probably my favorite business because you can You know add it for sales teams support teams and anytime someone has any questions and it was They had really really large enterprise agreements with some big big names that I can't say because they're under nda but public companies that you would recognize and That one was interesting Another one the marking automation platform for dentists that one sold really fast um, I did another one with um a company Called x mark clock, which is like a time management solution for construction workers And the guy was based in europe and he sold for over half a million again in less than 30 days um all cash transaction I'm just trying to think of the podcasts that have done There I mean, there's so there's so many so many sales to me like I think what people should do is if you end up going on Microquire, I've done this in a couple of different platforms Uh, basically you can learn a lot just by checking out the different businesses.

So even if you're not ready to buy Uh, get the premium subscription or whatever so you can read the like actual details about the businesses And that's like a you know, like a 300 mba that you can give yourself because you're going to discover all these different niches The patterns you're going to see which businesses sell for more which businesses sell quickly And it'll really shape your thinking. So that's kind of my recommendation is whether if you're buying obviously, you know It's no brainer, but even if you're not buying. I think this is a great way to learn.

I've done this. I've looked at probably 200 Online businesses for sale just with the only intention of like learning. Yeah, and um, and that's that's how my brain just sort of Collects a bunch of data. So I would recommend doing that Um, but we should we should wrap it here because we're gonna have to do one more segment after this But uh, edgier, thanks for coming on man. Thanks.
