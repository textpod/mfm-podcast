# February 27, 2020 - My First Million with special guest Julia Cheek

Date: 02/27/2020

Duration: 1 hours, 20 minutes, 11 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

We're good. We're here. Welcome back. Thank you. How was the big stage? You went to New York. Yeah. So what I did was I went to New York and I originally went to meet with some advertisers of ours and to be wanting and dining or what? Yeah, we yeah, kind of. I'll tell you about it. And then I went to be on the Gary Vaynerchuk podcast and then I went to be on. And I was like, is it a pop? Yeah, everyone knows him as pop. Pop. Yeah. And Anthony Pabellano or something. His podcast. It was cool.

Did Gary Vaynerchuk's podcast first thing in the morning at eight or nine or 10 a.m. when I got there. I was a little groggy from my flight because I took some medicine when I flew. It went okay. We'll see what happens. Gary. So you walk in. What what happened? Yeah. So walked in. So he has two offices in New York. One Hudson Yards, which I've been to before. It's buzzing. This one was a studio. It's a little quieter, but still pretty badass in Brooklyn. Long Island City. Long Island City. It is, which I don't know if that's Brooklyn or not, but it was awesome, man.

And you guys know each other. You don't know each other. So this is like the first time we met, but we had he knew who I was. And obviously I definitely know who he is and he knew who our company was. He he was totally nice and he was really low key at first. He wasn't like cocaine Gary. He was like you guys a little chitchat small talk beforehand or you just got into it. So here's what happened. We sat down and there's like an audience. There's like an audience of like 10 maybe five or 10 people.

Me. It was me and Adam on our side and then he had an entourage and we sit down and he goes, all right, go. And he looks at me and I was like, I looked at Adam. I was like, I was like, I'm just gonna go. I go Gary. I think you're interviewing me. He goes, Oh, I am. I was like, right, Adam like, is that right? And Adam looked at him. He goes, yeah, that's what we set up. Out of the safety blanket. Yeah. And Gary was like, Oh, okay. So tell me about who you are.

And it was good. It was great. So he's a nice guy. That's good to know. Yeah. You know, he's an easy target because he's so loud. Yeah. I believe the screen went off there. I believe that he is totally legitimate and a really good business person. I think his company Vayner is really, really hard to run and he said that he was currently the COO and CEO. But great business. I mean, good business and he's totally legitimate. He's like, because you can like What makes you say that? So you could put him in like the Donald Trump category of a guy who talks a lot and you're like, I don't know.

This guy's a real deal. He's totally the real deal. He just talks a lot. But what were the little tidbits that gave you that impression? Right? Because I believe that I'm not saying you're lying. So whenever I go to these offices, I ask them, I go, So how do you like working here? I always ask employees. I ask the front desk. I go, What's what, you know, and you can kind of tell if they actually like it. Yeah. And when he has 800 employees. So the office space was it was really expensive real estate. There was really nice furniture.

Everything was set up professionally. It's a real business. Right. So you could tell what's legitimate and what is it? Once you go in there in this Hudson and Yards office, they had Vayner media water, bottled water. The office was buzzing. Everyone had nice computers. It wasn't. It's not a startup. Right. Felt like a legit operation. Totally 100 percent. And kudos to him, man. He's talented. And you did the podcast. You know, rate your performance. I gave myself a C plus. Okay. And then because I was it was a I hadn't done any reps that day.

Like I did a podcast later that day and I had a red fire. And yeah, I was like, All right, I'm on it. It just was it just fell a little flat. But Adam and his people said it was one of their favorite ones they've ever done. And do you have a little prep routine you would do? Let's say before you get on stage, before you do an interview, how do you, you know, switch the light? Yeah, well, I typically will like, you know how it is like when we're doing this thing, I was in a piss.

I was in a shitty mood a minute ago and these lights turned on and you're like, I got a little like snap out of it. And what I do is I talk to the receptionist or I'll talk to the driver just to like start get out of your head. Yeah, get my words going and getting a better, happier mood. Yeah. And that's usually what I do. Okay. Is that what you do? No, like everything I try to like study and come up with like a framework for how to do it and like a technique. And so I picked up two things.

So I picked up one from Conor McGregor that he was watching this documentary. And I talked with a pencil in your mouth, pen in your mouth. Yeah. So this I tried it and it actually works fantastic. So basically, you take a pencil or a pen, you hold it sort of horizontal sideways, you bite on it. So it's in your mouth, you know, sort of going out past your cheeks. And then you just talk for one minute. And what happens is because the pencils there in your mouth in this awkward position, your tongue has to really work to like flick over and under this thing to get to the spots it usually goes to.

So you end up enunciating way better. I don't know if it's placebo. I don't know if it really is like an actual warm up for your tongue. But this shit works. I've recorded myself before and after and I can tell the difference. And other other people listen to it. I said, tell me which one of these sounds better. And I don't know whether it's placebo or not. That one works for me. The other thing is like a quick physical change. So push ups or something push ups, a wind spring, a jumping jack, a scream, music, whatever.

I am a big believer that that that the fastest way to change the way you feel is through changing your body rapidly. And it works. That's like a Tony Robbinsism. Tony Robbins says is great YouTube video. If you go look at if you just YouTube young Tony Robbins, and it's, you know, the same guy minus 25 years, he's in a tank top and he's in a tank top and he's given the speech and he talks about it goes before I get on stage, you know, people always ask me, okay, you're, you're a public speaker, you do, you do a really great job.

How do you do a great job of this? And he goes, because I don't make the mistakes. Most people do he goes, most people are sitting in a low energy shell. Their body body posture sucks. And then they just get up on stage and they don't warm up like an athlete would never do that. And he's like, I treat myself like an athlete. I get myself in a mental state, a physical state. And he goes, the second thing I do, I don't try to memorize what I'm supposed to say. Because when you try to memorize what you say, you're trying to prepare.

But what ends up happening is your mind is then editing. It's comparing what you're saying versus what you kind of remember you were supposed to say. And so you have this other whole thing going on in your head that takes you away from the moment. Third thing, and this is the last one. He goes, before I go up there, I convinced myself that the audience has to hear this. Like their lives depend on this information. Like they need, I'm here to help. And if I can get this across, like even with this podcast, for example, it's like, you know, somebody is out there, they're commuting.

They're, you know, they're, they have this idea that they haven't taken action on. They're kind of beating themselves up about it. Or, you know, they look around at the five people that they hang out with the most and they're just like, these people are not like me. And we're in their ear balls and they're like, Oh, there are people like me out there. And yes, I should take some action. And yes, I should have some fucking energy today. And so he's like, I just convinced myself that they have to hear this. And then I'm here to serve him.

And I was like, Okay, I do that. Just hearing that has made me feel better. There you go. Another thing that I did while I was out there is on Sunday night, I tweeted out. So when I fly, I take a lot of Xanax. It's the only drug I do. I don't do any alcohol. And sometimes the night before I'll take it a little bit as well because I really hate flying. And so on Sunday night, I tweeted that I rented this Airbnb, which I did. And I'm going to host a meetup. And I got 200 replies saying, Let's meet up.

Right. And that I couldn't do that. So I only let 20 trend subscribers come. And so the trend subscribers are also not 100 of you listeners or not 100% of listeners are subscribers, but all subscribers are listeners. Right. And they so I met I think at 30 ended up coming. And it was fucking awesome. It was so cool. This one kid flew up from South Carolina or something. And I treated us on the meetup was Monday night. I tweeted this on Sunday night. Like there was no preparation. Like we all we did me and Adam landed on a Monday morning.

We went to the Mexican place next door and said, Hey, can you bring over enough tacos for 20 people? Here's two or 300 bucks and go buy some beer. We'll pay you more money. And that's all we did. And it was awesome. Yeah, these people are fucking fanatical. It's crazy. It's nuts. It's really odd. Who was the most interesting person? So many interesting people. One guy there was this one guy. I forget his name. Maybe he's listening. He was an older the eldest guy there, which is not old, but then his 50s or 40s and he built was it builds custom electric cars, cars and through the trends group sold 50 cars.

Custom electric cars. Yeah, like he was making like they took a take a Prius or a four. No, they took. Yeah, they took like a some type of pickup truck and made it an electric delivery van. Oh, wow. For a cannabis company in LA because who else did I mean, I mean, I met all types of people. One guy who sells fake boobs for a living. So he sells his tell me more fair child. This guy ever talked to you on Twitter? No, his name is fair child Hunter. Yeah, yeah, I see this guy on my Twitter all the time.

Yeah, he his boss sells fake boobs for a living. Yeah, his boss invented like a better dude. What's in his bio because I've looked at this guy's bio and he's not advertising this. So let's see what he was talking about. This girl, a deity would just sit down a hundred came in. We were just shooting the shit. We're like, Hunter, what do you do? And this woman a deity. She's nice. I met her before. We were just sitting there. She's like, well, I sell breast implants. And we're like, what? And we just started talking. I was like, so do you have like a woman who comes with you and like shows you like shows the buyers like you need like sales brochures like how do you have like how do you show that your boobs are the best? And he was just like walking through this whole process.

It was crazy. I had never heard of such a thing. Yeah, me neither. But of course he came up from Virginia for this. That's great. All right, cool. So you can do more of that or what? Well, you and I need to do more. So what we can do is New York that we could get easily we could have gotten 200 people. Yeah. So we can do one in New York. I think a cast or whatever we use tells us where people are. Right. We got to go to Canada. We got to go to Utah.

When we shouted out Utah. I still get more. Dude, the number of these friendly ass Utah, you know, citizens, whatever they're called, Utah and reach out all the time like, hey, when you guys are here, I got you. So maybe like it feels good to be taken care of like that. It does. It feels great. Maybe hospitality. What's what month is it? February? Yeah. When you and the February, we should do a thing where we could try to hit up like three cities in five days. Right. Or maybe maybe I got into this thing. I don't know if I told you about this.

This thing called reality. Have you heard of this? No. So basically, you know, Jewish people have birthright. Yeah. And I don't know exactly how the mechanics of birthright work. But from what I understand, all about it. If you're Jewish, you get to go. It's paid by the sort of wealthy Jewish people around the world. And the Christian fundamental Christian Christians who believe that Israel is the land for Jews. Oh, wow. OK. I didn't know that. So basically, that's a cool thing for Jewish people. You're shaking your head. Are you Jewish, Henry? No. But you know about it? You just stunned.

Yeah. I've never been more jealous than when my friends go on birthright and then come back. It's like this mini study abroad. Yes. Great. And so then I was like, all right. What is this? How do we get more of this? So they have this program called reality, reality 2020 if you want to look it up. And it's basically you could be in these different groups. You can be in entertainment, you can be in technology, you can be in whatever social impact you apply to get in. And if you get in, I've applied before I got rejected a few years ago.

This time I applied, I got in. And it's like a small group. I don't know, 30 people, 40 people that get accepted and get to go. It's not all expenses paid, but it's like most expenses paid. And so, yeah. Anyways, if I'm going on this trip late May now and I'm going to see what this is all about to Israel. And I've heard of this. See if it does. Is it a Jewish thing? I don't think you don't have to be Jewish. This one's not like. But it's like a thing. But it's for like, you know, Israel's, you know, sort of startup and kind of thought leadership and young people, that sort of thing, a future leader.

I mean, it's like a, not in a bad way. It's a propaganda thing. It's like to get you into the Israel. Yeah, it's like a program. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm doing that. But my question to you. When are you going? It's late May. So first, scared of coronavirus may not go. I was supposed to go to Germany in May. So we should talk about coronavirus for a second. But secondly, why do Jews have all the good things? Why don't other people do this? This seems like a great birthright seems great. Jews and Mormons. Yeah, Mormons.

They're like the same thing. But Mormons might be better now because they don't drink. Do Mormons have these perks like that? Like birthright or something? Yeah, they all have all types of shit, dude. And they're all real good at basketball. And Jews love basketball too. I mean, dude, they're all like real similar. Very similar group of people. Well, the thing I like is the sort of pay it forward thing. I think Silicon Valley has this a lot where a lot of people who move here, they hesitate to reach out to people because they're like, well, why would this person want to help me? I have nothing to offer.

But like that is the culture of Silicon Valley is to pay it forward is to help the like next person who doesn't know anything. And I feel like Jews have this in their culture. And I feel like Mormons have this in their culture. You know, I'm Indian. I don't feel like there's this same. It's not as strong for Indian people to sort of try to help out the next. And I think part of it is because there's such a big population, you can't afford to do it. There's like, I don't know, 6 million Jewish people on Earth or something crazy.

And they run the world. So I think, you know, with a small number of people, you can offer this like much more high touch help each other model. I agree. Let me make one quick announcement before we get into it. And I wanted to make this on the top of this. Maybe maybe might chop it up. Maybe our editor can chop it up. But what I want to do is I've heard about these people say subscribe, unsubscribe, subscribe again. All right. And I want to test it. So last time we asked our viewers for more reviews and we now have 550 maybe we got 500 reviews in just a couple of days.

You guys are really active. And they all sent me messages. I tried to reply to everyone. Did you? I did now. Yeah, I went out. So here's you haven't got a reply. I thought you did get a reply. So here's what I want people to do. And the reason I'm going to I want to do this is because I think people like seeing a succeed and they like seeing the journey. Yeah, so you're going to help us succeed. So here's what you do if you have an iPhone, you're going to go to like the the the menu where you can like turn your Wi Fi and Bluetooth off and all that.

There's a button on the bottom right where you hit record. Okay, record that that's going to record your screen. Then go to the podcast app. Go to my first million. Click subscribe and then unsubscribe and then subscribe again. Send us a video of that happening. And if you do also send us a question that you want and we'll answer your question. Yeah, we'll bake a Q&A and this will tell us the truth, right? Because there's we need to run the experiment. We need to know is this how is this actually work or is this just like a myth? And if you send us your question, ideally send it via Twitter.

Yeah. So everyone could see and can comment in that way. It's easy. So just record yourself. Subscribe. What is it subscribing unsubscribing and then resubscribing do it a bunch of times record yourself. Post that on Twitter. Tag one of us or both of us. And then on that same thread, ask your question. And if you don't have a question, that's fine too. And then we're going to look at the charts and we're going to see what this does to the chart movement. I think it's going to actually boost the chart movement. If the theory is correct, you know, I believe this is why podcasters ask people to do this is because this shit actually works.

And if it does, here's what we'll do. If this does work, if people keep doing this, what we'll do is with only the people who do that, we'll like take a screenshot of our analytics and send it to them. Yeah, yeah, we'll share the data. Yeah, no problem. Okay, you want to get into some stuff? You want to talk about coronavirus or you want to? Yeah, coronavirus. Okay, so I'm terrified of coronavirus. And, you know, generically, I'm terrified. You know, I was terrified without information. And then I started looking into a little bit more. I don't even know about it.

Can you explain what the coronavirus is? Yeah, so basically, there's a couple of these viruses. They're influenza strains. And so the flu flu. Yeah. So basically, a few years ago, you probably heard, you know, SARS or swine flu. So, you know, the very first time I think SARS happened, there was, you know, a kid got this flu, goes to the doctor's office, they're like, okay, this is the flu. And kid dies within like a very short amount of time. They're like, well, that was odd. That doesn't usually happen. So they took a sample and sent it to like the CDC or whoever, right? Like they sent it to some lab to say, you know, what do you see here? There was this was a very unusual case.

The health deteriorated so quick, that's not typical to the flu. And what they realized was, hey, this is a new strain called, I think it was like H1N5 at the time. And it was like, this is only ever found in animals. This is the first time it's crossed over from animal to human. And so that was bird flu when that happened. And then so there's been these different sort of very, very deadly viruses, SARS, which are, which was very, very popular. MERS, which happened in the Middle East, respiratory syndrome is what's kind of what these Middle East respiratory syndrome is the what MERS stands for.

And SARS is sort of the same thing. And so the thing with these was that, you know, although there's a lot of hoopla around SARS and bird flu, like SARS killed less than a thousand people. Less than a thousand total fatalities, not a big drop in the bucket as far as the death bucket goes on earth. Coronavirus already killed like 3000 plus people. So already much bigger than that. The reason it's scary, though, is actually, and for a while people were like, oh, don't worry, the fatality rate is low. Fatality rates like, I don't know, 3% for this, whereas for SARS, it was like super high.

I don't know. I don't think that number was like majority of people who have it die. Whereas with this 3% means you get it, but you have a good chance of living. But the big problem with that and the article that I read was called why you're probably why we probably can't contain coronavirus, why you probably are going to end up getting coronavirus is because this virus is extremely contagious. But has these symptoms has these trademarks that are very problematic. So it takes a while for your symptoms to show up. So you have it and you carry it for like, you know, 14 days without showing symptoms.

So you'll be spreading this around and not even realizing you have it. Then once you have it, you don't just like deteriorate and like your health doesn't go to shit where they, you know, you're in the hospital, they quarantine you. It's like, you know, it starts innocent and it gets worse over time. So the infectious period is so much longer that there's basically no way to quarantine this thing. There's no way for us to contain this. And so what the article was saying was like, ironically, because it is not as fatal and is not as bad for you right away, this thing is going to be unstoppable, most likely case.

Second thing with that was, I guess there's four like, you know, typical strains of the flu, which is why you can get your flu shot and still catch the flu every year. So there's these four different strains and the vaccine doesn't cover sort of all all the different variations. And and so this guy's case was that most likely this is now just a fifth annual, you know, strain that we're going to have to live with and it's just going to suck. So very, very, you know, kind of a downer also, I'm sure, you know, sort of the bio nerds out there are going to be like, you know, there's 15 million strains.

That's right. But like, that's the summary that I took away. And if you want to just get the point, that's the point. And so what you have up here is D to C stuff. So like my, I looked at my portfolio yesterday as like, fuck. So lost money yesterday off of stock market. So crazy shit's happening all around. So generically stock market, you know, people get paranoid bonds, you know, people flee to bond stock goes down. That sort of thing. Other funny stuff happening, you know, zoom the conferencing software. So the stock ticker zoom goes up 50% today.

It's shit. It's up 50% today. But wait, there's more. It's the stock ticker Z OOM zoom. But that's not zoom's actual handle. Zoom's actual handle is ZM. So people are buying the wrong stock because they think people are going to be working from home and teleconferencing in. And so they're buying zoom, which does something else altogether. It's a very small cap stock. I don't know. Henry, check what the stock for Z OOM actually does. And it's a tiny stock. So it jumped 50% today. And like, you know, but you can actually predict this because this happened also at the IPO.

Whoever bought zoom, the other thing got his huge pop at zoom's IPO because of this. And so we could have predicted this one. I love when that happens, but all kinds of fucked up things. Some other things. Smart friends are basically saying, Hey, if you need my smart friends, you know, people who actually read the real information and like understand how the world works. They were like, Hey, if you need prescription drugs, you should start stockpiling because most of it's coming from China and the supply chain globally is fucked. And like the world doesn't have that.

Like friend of a friend, basically. How the fuck do you stockpile prescription meds? Basically buy up by your refills. And and so there's no global plan B for what happens if China gets sick or slowed down. We don't have another like supply chain and so all kinds of things are suffering. And I have friends that have DTC companies that buy their shit. They're back and they're saying shit. Yeah. Months months backed up. I was talking to a supplier yesterday and he was like, even if we come back to work, there's, you know, all the other factories that we depend on the printing factory, the packaging guys.

And they're not coming. Like the workers are just not coming back because in most factories in China, the workers don't actually live in that city permanently. So for Chinese New Year, which is when this happened. So Chinese New Year is a month long holiday. Yeah. Well, we have a Chinese intern. He tells us all about it. He goes, he goes, it's the largest travel day in the world because every Chinese person everybody goes home. And when they go home, they go back to very rural areas. And already there's this problem where they don't come, you know, often they don't come back because, you know, they don't want to be living in some other city working in a factory.

But with this, people are just not coming back. And so there's no replacements. It's like a very dire situation. Well, and like obviously at a human level, also incredibly dire situation. So to turn shit into gold, where's the opportunity here? I mean, what's going to happen? Do you think that this is going to impact, have long term impact with China making shit? And you have to go elsewhere? I don't know. So there's a question of like, so two theories. One is for stuff like this, the people who are going to do really well, they didn't start now.

They started something two years ago, a blog on being a prepper or whatever. And today's your day, you know, like this is your month. And so I don't think the, I don't know how much I am interested in the sort of like today opportunity also feels kind of fucked up. We talked about Judy the other day. Right. The Judy sort of survival bags. My friend Joe Spicer bought something from like survivor kit.com. And he got an email from them saying we have a hundred times our normal volume. I apologize, but we're going to make it happen.

Right. So those the Judy thing that which the respiratory mask. Those are not in the Judy bag, but the respiratory masks are just like out of stock. You can't get them. And that's like the thing you need is like to protect your nose and mouth. Long gone. No one can bounce on that. Yeah. We covered this guy who launched a company called Judy Judy. Judy. Yeah. Judy. It's a emergency kit. Yep. An orange like emergency backpack. Ready to go. My wife texted me today and said, what's going by a bunch of stuff? I feel the same way.

More people are doing this. Have you ever been in an emergency situation? By the way, have you ever like been in a city when like a flood happens or anything like that? It's really bizarre how it feels. No, I was in Hawaii, our honeymoon. There was a hurricane in Hawaii. Oh, I left when I was there. And so we went to the grocery store. And at first we go to the hotel and they're like, Hey, we have early check in available. And we're like, well, that's cool. Thanks. Cause we're a honeymoon. And they're like, no, we just have like a lot of open rooms.

I was like, what's going on? They're like, well, have you seen the weather report? Like there's our hurricane this week. And of course I don't take the weather. So I booked my honeymoon on a hurricane week. And so we go to the grocery store and it's like the zombie attack has happened. Like all the water bottles are gone. Like the shelves are empty. People are just checking out like four carts worth. It's really like, it's a odd, eerie, eerie feeling when that happens. Yeah. This thing, my issue, here's an opportunity if someone wants to go for it.

You know how pull, uh, is it, uh, there's a political check. Is that what it's called? A political, political fact. You mean like the fact checking thing? Yeah. I don't know what it's called. But yeah. So what you do is like, did Bloomberg really say this? Right. And it goes, that's what I want for a coronavirus right now. I don't know what the truth. So there's a blog called, I believe it's called theprepared.com. It is exactly what you want. It is plain English. It's like, here's the facts, not the overreaction. And by the way, we'll tell you about the overreaction and why it's an overreaction.

But here's the facts presented in a calm, calm way. The site is beautiful. It works great on your phone. I tweeted at the guy who started like, this is a, like, thank you for making this. Yeah. I was like, thank you for making this site. Cause this is exactly what I need in this situation. It auto filled nicely. A bunch of people must be going to, I feel like it's, ah, he's selling kits. He's selling kits. Oh God. This guy's awesome. Cool. I'm into this. So scary situation. Yeah. Scary all around. Best of luck to everybody.

Yes, for sure. Okay. You want to move on or? Yeah, let's move on. Okay. I'll, I have a few interesting things that happened. Cool companies that we can talk about. The first thing is something that has made a huge impact on me. And I think more people need to take advantage of it, which is transparent numbers. So basically there's a group of people out there who believe that transparency is good. Um, and they share all of their revenue. They chair, they share their every metric about their business as deep as everyone's salary, their bank balance, churn, how much it costs to, um, acquire a customer, how much a customer stays on for everything.

Some are a little bit less, but they'll share how many customers they have, how much revenue they have, what their bank balance is. More people should follow, uh, these businesses. I for one, totally against that. I don't think you should ever reveal that, but I'm happy they do. And I, and, um, and so some examples. So throw them out. Okay. So, uh, first of all, my friend on core, what's on course last name? He runs teachable. Uh, I don't remember his last name. Um, if you Google on, can you tell me on course last name, uh, founder of teachable.

Okay. So he reveals, uh, on Twitter, the valuation of every round. What is it? Nagpal. Yes. Not say it. Nagpal. Nagpal. Uh, he reveals the valuation of every, every time they raise like 20 million bucks at a, whatever. 100 something really good. And he reveals how much revenue they have, how many customers they have. It's awesome. Yes. I love that. The other guy is Sahil Sahil, uh, from gum road. Shitty business. Seems like an awesome guy. Uh, he reveals every single month. Yeah. All the, you could Google gum road founder Sahil. It's on his Twitter.

If you, he just, he doesn't have a tweet. Lancet after you don't even have to dive into the books. It's like, here's 140 characters. Um, Joel for buffer. He does this. They actually just switch. So if you go to bear metrics.com or Google bear metrics, they have like 18 different companies that do this. And it's pretty cool. And Joel from buffer used to be on there. They're a $22 million a company. So pretty valuable. And they were, were, were revealed everything, everything. Employees salaries, like name, salary, equity, you know, level, everything. And you know what? They're changing.

They're showing less and less. Have you talked to them? Do you know why it becomes problematic when you add more people? Um, yeah. Duh. It's like, you know, guy, you know, creates, you know, turns his kitchen into a man cave instead, gets a girlfriend and is like, oh, she doesn't like it. It's like, yeah, no shit, man. Like I could have told you this, like when you bought the plasma and put it on the fridge. They grow up Joel. Yeah. People don't like their salary being public. What? So they still do salary. They still do equity.

People get upset when they see their coworker who slacks off and works from home two days a week and they see his salary. Because people don't understand that like different people have different situations. It's not like. So, so they did it, I think, in a smart way, which is they basically were like, they use it as customer acquisition. Yeah, it's part of their story because they got their ass kicked by HubSpot. And so they like, you know, this has become a bit of a playbook for small business to business SaaS companies, which is look, you know, acquisition of customers is hard.

If my customer is a small business owner, what is small business? What would bring a small business owner to me? What content could I put out there that would make a small business owner come? So instead of saying seven tips to have more effective meetings, they were like, here's our here's our P and L for this month. And sure enough, a lot of people wanted to see that. So a lot of people discovered their product through this. And so, you know, maybe this lines up totally with their values and that's why they did it. But I just definitely it was a great way for people to discover their business.

I didn't use buffer, but I read all their shit. And if anybody ever needed a solution like buffer, I was like, Oh, buffer, you should use buffer. Why? Because otherwise I wouldn't have even known about them. And so this was a pretty counterintuitive thing that they did. And they were the only ones doing it. And so you always get paid when you're the only one doing it. If it's juicy. Yeah. And so one more person who's doing it and his business is way better than buffer. I love this guy's business. So it's my friend Nathan Berry.

I've met Nathan a while ago. And Nathan has this company called ConvertKit. They do close to two million and monthly recurring revenue. So 24 million he owns 100% of it. Right. It's probably a hundred to $200 million company. Like it's really valuable because once customers are locked in, it's basically a MailChimp competitor. It's an email service. That seems high. Two million a month, you said? Two million. Oh, that's for sure. That's how much they do. So they're doing two million. No, that's worth that. So 24 million a year. So 24 million you think they're worth what? Ten times.

Ten times. Okay. It's grown like a weed. Maybe. People don't switch from their email platform. Yeah. It all depends on the retention. So can you pull up actually? Can you open up their metrics? So just Google like Bearmetrics dashboard or something. I forgot what the URL is, but it's like something.bearmetrics.com. And it's like their whole company. It's like, here's so many new customers we got. Here's how many people churned this month. It's like all of their graphs and you can use it for your company. He even showed how much profit they make. I think it's like convert kit.

It's like, yeah, here it is. You got to zoom in. There you go. So this, I don't know if this is their business or this is like the example thing, but it's like monthly recurring revenue, net revenue, fees. This is somebody else's business. You got to do convert kit. Yeah. Do convert kit Bearmetrics. Type in convert kit revenue. Maybe if you can't spell. I also use convert kit. I actually pay for subscription because I'm like, this product is so fucking powerful. I don't actually have many sequences set up. I have a sequence of one email right now, which is not a sequence.

It's just an email, but I think it's a great product. I love convert kit. I love Nathan. Nathan's a great guy. Nathan's only 26 or seven years old. We talked about the idea of doing a drip sequence to build a newsletter for women going through pregnancy and like week by week. And I had a friend, sorry, no, I had a random listener reach out on Twitter. It was like, I'm doing this. Here's my kind of unique asset I have to go about this. And how should I set this up? And I sent them to convert kid.

I was like, dude, your problem is going to be solved in like, you know, the next 90 minutes. What are people leaving Bearmetrics? Why can't you find it? Here you go. 1.7 million. Oh, is that it? What's the URL? Yes. 1.7 million monthly recurring revenue. And you could just look at the. It'll say churn. So annual run rate doing 20 million in a year, which is up 1.7%. That's got to be how much this month. Revenue churn 5.1% per month. That's not bad. It's not great either. Well, it's because it's a small to medium business.

Like if you're churning 5% a month, that's like what's the net growth? So 5% a month is the churn. What's the new business every month? One and a half percent. Yeah, so he's net negative then per month. No, I think that that churn, that growth month, that growth number takes into account churn. I see. Okay, gotcha. Okay, that's the net. But this is because it's the average revenue even says so they make on average $60 is it $60 a month per user. Right. And the thing on the right, one of medium business going to have a higher churn compared to other staff.

If you're real sick, you can just look at the live stream on the right and see every minute when somebody pays them. It'll say like right now it says $29 paid by, you know, anonymous company. Dude, he's got a lot of failed payments here. Get on that Nathan. What's going on? You can't be failing. It's three out of the 12 payments here are failed. Four. He has a chart that says which one's failed. So these these companies are badass. I so you wouldn't do it. No, I think what about a part of what you do? The email list size, the revenue.

I don't want to share anything publicly. I'll say like eight figures or something. No, I just don't think it brings a lot of good either. You know when a company is trying to raise or sell their business because like two months before all these articles will come out just like handing over handing over information. Yeah. Why is that happening? Because they want to raise their rather they want to sell their company within the next six months. I don't. Can you go to the next go back to the Google Doc? No, I'm not a fan of it.

I want to I want to do my first conference when I was younger. It made like 60 grand in profit and I told everyone in the blog post and I hated the attention. So I'm never going to do that again. Okay, so let's talk about pipe.com. You know pipe.com. I saw this and I was like, dude, this is awesome. I was I came to the I came to our little scratch pad to write it down and you already had it written down. Okay, so here's what here's here's let me set the stage here. So when you have a subscription business, I'm talking about software subscription, but maybe it could work for all types of stuff.

What happens is you do one of two things. The first is you say, all right, you signed this deal and you owe us $200 a month. And so that is a $2,400 a year subscription service. And the company that is your customer will pay you $200 a month. What a lot of companies prefer to do, but this is actually a lot harder is they say, all right, you signed one year contract. Let's get all of your payment up front. Right. Now, here's the balance here is do you want or this is what people think they can either get more customers and allow them to pay monthly.

Right. Or they can get less customers but allow them to pay annually and get all of that cash flow up front. And what what's it called pipe? What they do pipe.com. If you have a business like convert kit and they have a history of three years and it says, look, every month our turn rate historically is 5%. Pipe can go, okay, so you have all these customers paying you each month. Let's just, I don't know how they discount it, but they probably they probably discounted a lot. So they do risk it in this. Let's just assume that you're going to have 20% monthly churn.

Right. We're just going to we'll give you all that money up front and you owe us as the money comes in with a little bit of interest. Right. Awesome. Awesome business. So I have so many thoughts. All right. So a couple of things. First, the financial infrastructure. What's what's really going on here? The financial infrastructure for software companies and tech businesses is being rebuilt. So we already had investors, right? Angel investors, seed investors, series A investors, blah, blah, blah. But then you have a bank for startups, Mercury started by, you know, some successful founders from Hazel.

They started Mercury. It's supposed to be a bank designed for startups. And then you have things like Brex or ramp, which we talked about, which is like business credit card designed for startups because the legacy institutions don't understand how to value these companies, how to assess risk, how to like fund and finance these companies. Then you have things that are, you know, like marketplaces where you've been buying sell to buy and sell online businesses, like quite like brokerage or wherever. You have due diligence firms that pop up that specialize in software business like Centrica. Then you have, you know, guys like pipe, which basically say, great, you know, you have a cash flow problem, but you have steady.

We know you have a predictable book of business. We will give you the cash up front and we'll take a big off the top of that. And so I think these are all really smart businesses, each one at a different part of the financial stack. Yeah, software technology. We use it. It's pipe, but for media and publishers and pipe has raised 70 million in funding. They're kind of stupid because we use them and we have a million, millions of dollars in credit from them. And we won't leave them because it's a wonderful service. But the reason why they're kind of stupid is because the market's a lot smaller than software and the numbers are a lot smaller.

I think pipe will be a multi billion dollar company. Yeah, or the one problem with these is there's a lot of competition. Yeah, I think the aggregate will be so, for example, this is also happening on the customer side, right? So companies like Affirm or Cezul or Afterpay. Yeah, that's on the consumer side, but same idea, which is like they're trying to provide different financial instrument that like the traditional financial company like the current sort of incumbents aren't really figuring out how do we help eCommerce companies? Sort of how do we help merchants, you know, turn their products into monthly payments for their customers? But Affirm came out and did it and you know, fast pay or sorry, not fast pay Afterpay.

I think Afterpay is like a eight billion dollar company or something like that in Australia. Affirm is a multi billion dollar company here doing the exact same thing and they're all fighting over these merchants. I love this shit, man. I say fuck the big banks. I fucking hate them. Yeah, I hate them so much. I hate having to talk to a rep. They don't understand me. Right. They don't understand what we're doing. So Ishan are the producer and editor for the podcast. He had an idea. So I asked him one day because I, you know, I have him on as sort of my right hand man.

So sometimes I just ping him with just random questions. I said, what's the biggest idea in your head right now? I was like, you know, what's the biggest startup idea you got? And, you know, he's 20, 21 years old. I don't know exactly how old he is, but he's a young guy. And so he goes, well, I've been a, you know, freelancer contractor for you and many other people for last few years. And he's like, why doesn't a sort of fast pay or pipe exist for contractors? Like I have my invoice. Just give me the money now.

And then you wait to like when the company pays you take it and you take 5% off the thing. And I've actually heard this idea a few times before of like, you know, my wife was a consultant, you know, and so she always got paid like this on a 30 or 60 day cycle. And she would have, you know, 20 grand sitting and outstanding payments. If she could just get the 20 grand, you know, headache free, she would take 1950, you know, she would take 19,000 out of that just to get the money now and not have to keep following up via email to be like, hey, have you paid it yet? And like all that stuff.

And so the problem seems real. And this is more of a question to the audience of like, what am I wrong about? What don't I get about this idea? Seems like a great idea on the surface. What's the problem with this idea? Because I've heard it bandied around a few times over the years. It's not a, it's not a like super niche idea. I think a lot of people could have this idea. So what's wrong with it? And I think that you can learn just as much from common ideas that don't work as you can from great ideas that do work.

If you start to identify, why does this seemingly good idea not work? Why have people tried and failed over and over again? There's a lot to learn as an entrepreneur. Yeah, I'm digging that. So pipe.com's out. I'm loving those things. Alright, we want to talk about book club stuff. Yeah, one thing. Hey, Henry, there's a guest downstairs. Would you mind letting her in and she's going to join us for like the next segment? Yeah. Julia, what's up? Hi. How are you? Doing well. Thanks for having me. You're already in my good books because you actually listened to the podcast.

Not all the guests do. I do my homework. Yeah. Which I do my homework. Yes. I have a, there's a bunch of employee fans. Great. They found out and it was, I mean, like they had been really gunning for me to have a chance to do that. Shout out to them. Do you have like that like corny name for your employees? Like, oh, you're well in so. That is literally it. Oh my God. Although you've changed it. That's not really it. Well, but then everyone was like, hey, did you just like come up with that? Because that is not that great.

And so I think like, you know, someone better with words was like, how about just Everly's? I was like, oh, that's better. That sounds like a good one. We've shifted it to that. Do you guys have this, the hustle? Do you have like, plusloneans or something? No, I would say no. Yeah. No. You're fired actually if you say something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, with Bebo, somebody tried to like do that and I was like, thank God there's not a nice one because I don't want this as like a thing. Yeah. Beber's that would have been it.

By the way, I'm followed by Justin Bieber on Twitter. No big deal. Like for real? Yeah. So cross 10,000 followers and Justin Bieber follows me. I DM him. He did not reply. How many people does he follow? It's got to be one of those bots that just follow you. How many people does he follow? I don't know. Henry, Justin Bieber, a number of followers. We'll find out. The only way this can go is down for me where he follows millions of people. It's not a low number, my friend. It's not a low number. Yeah. Okay.

It's 300,000. I'm one of the top 300,000 friends of Justin Bieber. That's better than I would have thought. I thought the number was going to be like 10 million. So for what it's worth. Okay. So speaking of, so you have, so you're Julia Everlywell is your company name, but your name is Julia Cheek. Yes. It's a cool name. Thank you. I'm going to take my last name. And so I'm always thinking like, you know, just totally rebranding it to something cool. But then I know people will be like, did you just change your last name to try to sound cool, which is probably the least cool thing you could do.

Right. I kind of got the opportunity to do that because I decided I had a choice to do Julia Taylor, which was my maiden name, or if I wanted to, when I got married, take on Cheek. Yeah. And it was just sort of unique. So I did it. You did it. Okay. Great. And so for people listening who are like, okay, great. Who's this person? Why are they joining the show? They're like, I'm going to be here for 30 seconds about what's interesting about you. Yes. So I'm Julia Cheek. I'm the founder and CEO of Everly Well.

We are based in Austin. We are about to celebrate our five year anniversary, which is hard to believe, but probably the most interesting thing about me starting this company is I started a company in the blood testing space in the direct to consumer space, coming with no entrepreneurial background or healthcare background whatsoever, and had every kind of X in the box of why you would work. You were a consultant, right? I was a management consultant. Yeah, where? And I went at Deloitte, went and got my MBA, had a really traditional Harvard, had a really traditional corporate path.

Sam's all about the pedigrees. Yeah. I hate it. I don't care. Sam's like, Harvard, okay, I'm in. Yeah. There's definitely some interesting ties, I think, that turned me on to being an entrepreneur when I was there. But certainly, like I was really on the corporate path and then had this idea when I was working at MoneyGram and left my job to do it, and I can confidently say 100% of people who know me was like, this is definitely going to fail. There's no way it's going to work. So what's the company doing? Yeah. So when I was, five years ago, when I was working at MoneyGram, I had a bunch of all these unexplained health symptoms.

This is super common, what you hear from women in their late 20s and their 30s is they have chronic fatigues and pains. They're not taken seriously at doctors. And so I went to five or six different doctors on good health insurance and each of them ran different blood tests. I never got my results. I paid over $2,500 out of pocket. Nothing material showed up or was communicated to me. What do you mean you never got your results? Like you personally didn't receive it? Like I personally didn't receive it. The doctor looks at it. Or even if they called me, like I missed the call, nobody ever called.

They said, we'll call you if anything's abnormal. Well, like what does that mean? You tested 100 different things. Like just because something's not totally out of whack doesn't mean there's not interesting or useful information there. So I sat down and I looked at the health insurance landscape and I thought, man, people are going to have to start paying for all this in a more meaningful way than we are today. And I'm at least confident that my cohort of women between like 25 and 45 can't get the testing that they need. And I think I can solve that.

And so it really started out honestly, not that it wasn't a big vision, but it was a little bit like if you think about the first group you're solving a problem for, that's what we launched for. So today we have 35 different tests on Everlywell.com on Amazon, Target, CBS, Kroger. We work with Humana and we offer consumer initiated testing for everything from STI testing, heart health, food sensitivity, et cetera. Basically, is it every test? It's like 90% of common test coverage from what you would get from the doctor. I've raised over $50 million from West and East Coast VCs.

That was after obviously having like three rounds of clawing my way through funding and then suddenly things did get easier. And we actually grew from zero to, see we did 40 million in sales last year in our third year in operation. Is that okay? No coronavirus, but this is how it goes. No coronavirus, yeah. Especially for the healthcare entrepreneur and we have to learn not to do that. We're here to talk about coronavirus. Do you guys solve coronavirus tests? Yeah, you know, if we did, I think we'd, I wouldn't be here right now. I mean, doing something else, but I'm hopeful there's progress as we learned today from Gilead and a couple other companies.

I'm hopeful someone's close on it. So, but no, we don't have that unfortunately. Are those one time purchases for 40 billion? No, it's, I mean, it's a combination of new customer acquisition and repeat. We have a really healthy repeat business because a lot of our tests are things like cholesterol, thyroid. It's not recurring. We do have enterprise contracts that are recurring for Medicare. But it's a mix of what I would call one time repeat and then actual recurring contracts, which is there's challenges. There's good and bad. I think when you have a one time heavy business upfront, you have to build a good set of unit economics from the get go so that you're not just optimizing on this like promise of payback.

Right. Right. So that's been good for us. On the other hand, we've had to be super, super disciplined in a way that I think some consumer brands haven't been. Right. And so you're based out of Austin. Yeah. So you have to be at home. Yes. Test that then gets sent to a lab, a partner lab. They analyze it. You get the full report. It's like, here's everything. Here's what's interesting about this. You can share it. It's like the way that it should be. Like if you didn't even, you didn't have to like invent this. If you just asked a lay person, you're like, how should this work? Right.

That's the description. And then you just made that like happen in real life. The other thing that's interesting is you were on Shark Tank. I was. Yes. As a fan of reality TV, both watched the challenge, probably the trashiest reality show. Well, tonight's the season finale of the Netflix one. Of the circle. No, the one where they get married after they live in a room. Love is blind? Yeah. Didn't it all come out already? And they just released it. Today. Today. No, I'm at episode three of that one. Good show. It's pretty awesome. Pretty good show.

Have you seen it? I haven't seen it yet. Do you know the premise? I do know the premise. They put people in rooms and they don't see each other. Yes. It's actually a pretty cool description. Oh, then they have to get married. I missed that part. Or you can cut off the show. Like, you don't even get like eliminated survivor style. You just edit you out. Like you just not shown ever again if you didn't propose. And so what ends up happening is it's 10 days behind a wall. You talk to this person and you're speed dating basically behind a wall.

Pretending. So you're kind of like deciding who you like. Yeah. And then someone proposes through the wall. So they're like, can you come close to the wall, please? I'm on a knee now and I want to, you know, ask you to marry me. And then, but the thing is that I thought that's where the show would end. But then they like put them in the real world together and they're like, all right, you're going to get married in 30 days and see what happens. That's interesting. It's pretty interesting stuff. Okay. Good job, Netflix. Yeah. Are you asking her about Shark Tank? Yes.

Because tell me about how it came about. You applied many times, one time. How'd you get on? Yeah. So Shark Tank was an, honestly, I am a huge fan of the show. I also am a huge fan of my own experience. And that's not, I think, what everyone has to say. But I always tell people, I think it can be a really game changing thing for entrepreneurs if you do it the right way. It is a lot of fricking work, a ton of work. Really? So I... Once you're on or before you're on? Before you're on.

Okay. So I would say like, so I, we aired in November of 2017. Good to be beginning to catch you, but audition. But it was like a nine month process of, I would say the year of 2017, 80% of my year was just Shark Tank related things. So we applied, and by we me, it's like a 50 page written application that you do. Online or... No, it is printed and written out. And I tried to like use a PDF editor. I mean, it was like, yeah, like, you know, it was like a decade ago. So you write this whole thing out.

I write this whole thing out. I will be honest. I was, I was a finalist at TechCrunch Battlefield in 2016. The producers scout from Battlefield companies. So they reached out. So it's kind of like if you're thinking about American Idol, maybe, which I would never be, but you're, you either can get contacted and sort of put in the front and to audition or you kind of blind audition or wait line. So it's not that I had necessarily a better chance, but I did get shortcut into the application process. So filled that out. The application probably takes 40 hours.

And then you have to sign all their contracts and basically sign your identity and image away to ABC for, in perpetuity. And then from there, you do a voice interview with producers. You do a video interview as well with the application. Then another video interview of your pitch. And then from there, the producers work with you for about four months on like, what is your story? What is your brand? What is your script? And it's ultimately your, what I think people don't realize on Shark Tank, it's a human interest story. You are there to make good reality TV, but it is your decision.

The producers will help you and advise you, but this is your gig and it's up to you to decide how you want to display yourself and who you want to be on TV. But they can then decide whether or not to air you. So you still remember your opening because you probably drilled it like a thousand times. I did. And I will tell you, I thought I was like really good and comfortable at public speaking. And then I did this and I was like, okay, I was really bad. And now I feel comfortable. I did.

So I signed or I shook on the largest deal ever for a female entrepreneur in terms of valuation. So yeah, with Lori Grineer, she is on board. She's been tremendous. Because of QVC or what? For me, it was really at the time we had no brick and mortar retail presence. And I knew that that was a priority for us to create a product that was like actually accessible and ubiquitous. And that's actually, in hindsight, been a really good move for us, but I felt that she would be invaluable in helping us to get in those stores.

Yeah. She really helped with packaging and branding and making something that's accessible when you're trying to like sell a testing kit where either people think it's a DNA kit or they have no idea what it is. Being able to differentiate that when you have like 10 seconds to grab some of the information. So the deal we shook on was... Why do you say shook? Because there's the shake and then there's the actual deal. What's the actual deal? I can't disclose that. Oh. However, it was different. Yes. Better or worse. Better for the company. And probably better for Lori.

And better because... Honestly. Why does the deal change? So normally there's like, they do diligence and they might change it probably for their favor. You're saying it went better for you guys. It went better for the rest. How does it improve? So there was a... And it's very case by case. So what happens after the show is... I'll make sure you project because your audio... What you're saying is great. I want to make sure we're getting it all. So my audio paranoia. Right here. Just make sure you're... Talk louder than you're comfortable talking. So after you shake on the deal on the show, a fair number of those deals, I think it's something like over half never come to fruition at all.

And then another quarter or so actually change. And then another quarter get done at the terms that you shook on. I had a bunch of friends that they screwed. The sharks screwed these... Each shark has a different approach. So they're totally... You then go into their management company. Right? So you're going into Mark Cuban companies or Lori Gernier's companies. And so it's not a... I don't know what each shark's process is. I can say Lori's was super fair. They go through very detailed diligence on everything. But you know what? The show actually does diligence on you.

They have a venture analyst on board. So they run diligence on you before you ever pitch. What was your valuation? You guys agreed on that. I pitched... I... My valuation was 20 million post money. And how much did she invest? So that was a... It was a line of credit deal at an 8% interest rate for 5% of the company. And was it like... So... You know, hey, deal offer on the spot or do you have this like long pause where you're like, can I think and write this down? Well, in my case, every shark was out.

And I actually knew I wanted either Lori or Mark... Sorry, Lori or Mark Cuban. And so I was really excited about it. And so I really did want to work with her and it was a good deal. So I actually sat on the show because you're supposed to negotiate. I said, because it makes good TV. And so I said, I know I'm supposed to negotiate, but I want to take this deal. So I didn't. You do have... It is really what you see. Like you can exit, you can talk about it with your partner, you can call a lifeline or a friend.

They may edit that out or whatever else, but you can take a minute to think about it. Well, something people don't see or don't realize that is different from having actually gone through it versus watching it. What's one difference? I think people know it's edited. I don't think people realize how long the actual time filming can be from when you walk in and walk out to like what they edit down to 5 minutes. So it varies, but mine was probably an hour and they edit it to 7 minutes. Some people have gone on up to 2 to 3 hours.

Some are 15 minutes, right? And so I think you know it's edited to a degree, but I don't think you realize how much discussion actually happens when you're pitching. She is investing her own money. Always. So then does she have a fund or is it literally just hers? It is in a fund structure, but it's her capital. It's her money. How long do you think she's worth? You know, I don't know. I will say she is a prolific salesperson in the sense that like the top three or four companies from Shark Tank, and I mean companies that have done like a quarter of a billion in sales, squatty potty.

Yeah, it's those. She has a relationship with each of those companies and is invested in each of those companies. So I suspect quite a bit not to mention her own patent portfolio and the success she's had with products. She has a great team. But do those pay cash flows? I mean, who cares if you, I mean, it's important, but if you own equity in that business. And there's not an exit. Yeah, so I don't know. Where is her cash coming from? I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Well, because I also agree with that.

Well, and I also don't know. She takes that Saudi money. Each deal is different, right? So like she does it just like an NEVC deal is different, right? She's negotiating a deal with me that's different. I don't know what terms are, you know, with the rest of her companies. I do know she has put all of these companies on the map from scrub daddy to squatty potty, these companies that have incredible consumer product range. Now she delivers. Yeah. So I'm telling you, I think it seems to be actually, I don't have one, but it does seem, I mean, it does seem very popular apparently.

So, okay. So, so every little question for you. We actually get the test. How do you actually register? Wait, hold on. Let me ask one more question on the chart. And then we'll end on chart. How much traffic did your site get? Oh yeah. So we got, I don't know if it was, it was November. We are even better than that. Because it's more traffic. Oh yeah. TV more than. Right. We did the night before Cyber Monday. It was Thanksgiving weekend. It couldn't have been a better day. All of my poor team, they were wonderful.

They canceled all their Thanksgiving. It was, you know, a lot of work. But what we got about 30 times our normal traffic, but we had an interesting experience. We didn't have this tremendous like huge spike the night of in terms of purchases, but we ended up doing about a million dollars in sales, which at the time was a tremendously large number for us in like the four day period after. The show. So there's been a little bit of this interesting thing for us that I haven't heard many other companies have, which is we doubled, like we doubled in that week on a run rate standpoint, and then we continue doubling the next month.

And we never had that decline. But we didn't have this spike in like the three hour period that we aired. Yeah. We had a lot of traffic. A lot of traffic. Like a million sessions. Yeah, uniques. Yeah. So, and we did, I mean, we had to, I mean, at the time we were not set up for that scale. Now we don't even have to think about it. We know we've always been on on Stripe, not WooCommerce, not Shopify. We've built, we've built on it now and like totally customized it. It's not, I know, but it's one of the big ones that actually I think we should have gone to Shopify, but we didn't.

So I shouldn't now I shouldn't name them because it's going to sound bad. But yeah, exactly. I like to think he's listening. Yeah. We're trying to get them off. I was going to say that valuation, right? Yeah. That's right. You lost the streams on Twitch. Great guy. Oh. So, yeah. So we saw a really good traffic increase, but it was a very different pattern. And Lori warned us about that. She said some companies, it's like they sell out immediately and some companies it's just a slow kind of a slow burn. So that was what it was with us.

But we did not crash, which was essential. Do you have a bunch of questions? Do you have some? Not about sharp tank though. I mean, close the check on sharp tank. I know enough. Stay tuned. There may be an upcoming thing there. We'll become back as one of the Glory children. Potentially. Potentially. We are actually in two years with a number, I think we're number 10 on the all time best selling list out of nine seasons. Those socks and then squatty potty. Bomb us. Oh, they were on there? Yeah. Number one. 250 million in sales.

Shit. Yes. I'm worried about that. I'm worried about the best socks. You have Bomb Us? Yeah. I went on Twitter. I said, what's the best sock money can buy? When we sold the company, I was like, I'm going to buy unlimited of the best sock. That's the thing I'd always told myself. That's cool. I'm going to become a millionaire, unlimited best socks. Bomb Us was like what everybody said. Do you love them? Yeah, I love them, but I need more. That's it. That's right. I'm involved. Yeah. I bought the whatever the like 60 pair or whatever.

But like I think I need like 500 pairs of socks. Like laundry. You know, that's like one of the best hacks you could do is what I did was I bought, I only have one pair of underwear, but I own like 30 of them. Yeah. One pair of socks and I own 50 of them. Yeah. So I never match socks. Yeah. It's the greatest hack ever. Yes. I've been doing since I was 18. Should we? A pod. Okay, so I have a question for you. Yes. Let's say I buy the product. What do I actually do at home when I take this? Like physically, what is this? What do I have to do? So this, people are often surprised how many people we get to take their blood at home, but that's often what it requires.

So like most of our testing is pricking your finger to draw a small sample of blood. Summer saliva, summer urine, but obviously there's a reason why they normally take your blood at a lab. It's because you can analyze the most number of markers and the broadest assortment of markers using blood. So it's a dried blood spot testing. It's like a very frankly old school model. Your method? Yes. Quest, LabCorp, all of the labs have dried blood spot testing. This is nothing novel. Just means you're pricking a finger and you're dropping blood onto a treated paper or a treated device that is then, the blood is then drying.

But you guys aren't doing this. We're not. You're a middle person. We're a middle person, which if you were a VC responding to me back in 2016, I was a marketing company. That's what I was going to say about when you take offense to it. No, I don't take offense to it. So that's the most important part. Right. I think it's interesting when people are like, oh, well, you're just a middle man or you're just marketing. But I really view us more as, okay, the labs are our manufacturing partners. You don't buy things directly from manufacturers typically.

You buy them from a brand. So we have seven different partner labs we work with. Probably the one that runs the majority of our business is Perkin Elmer, which is a publicly traded life sciences company. They're huge. They're global. And they've been really a good partner to scale in. They have a lot of credibility. They're the worldwide leader in dried blood spot testing. So it's been a good. Because what everyone grows up wanting to be. The worldwide leader of dried blood spot testing. Hey, I know, but you know what? For us in our space and we're in the medical space, it's really important to have that stamp, especially with all the failures that have happened.

So we really want you to hear Sam's thoughts on food allergy testing, Sam. Yeah, I can wait. I'm excited. I think that a lot of them are bullshit. Yeah. Am I right or wrong or what are you going to do? I think it depends. And you mean. We talked about this earlier. It's important and it's. But they do every test though. We do every test. It's okay if I don't find one of them. You know, it's interesting. Well first of all, so to correct you, there's a major difference between a food allergy and celiac disease and then a food intolerance or a food sensitivity.

That's not a good thing. It's intolerance. Okay. So, but just for, you know, listeners, I think it is important because even doctors just say allergy and sensitivity is the same thing. I definitely am. So, it's an allergy intolerance test to chiropractic. Interesting. Yeah. Okay. I was like, I think that it sounds good, but it doesn't work. You know, it's interesting. We have become associated. This food sensitivity testing in general has become associated with Everly Well, which I suppose is like I'm proud of from a brand standpoint. But on the other hand, it's been going on for over 30 years and there's thousands of doctors that do both IgG, IgA testing around the U.S.

and most people that you talk to, if you've talked to them about food intolerance, they'll say, oh yeah, I had that done at my allergist or I had it done it. Nutritionists or at my general practitioner, it has to be used in a specific context to be valuable. And so, I do think that is why it's really important that you educate people on how it should be used. It should be used within an elimination diet. It is not a be all end all. It's a guidance. It is something, it is our test where we have more people quantitatively say it's changed their lives than any other test.

But and there's good research around it for that use. What there's not good research around is saying like it's it diagnoses you with an allergy. It can just be used as kind of a black and white guidance of what you should and shouldn't eat. That's absolutely not true. So, I think there's a lot of misinformation. I think there's a lot of different types of testing and the nomenclature gets mixed up for things that shouldn't be used for. And I think it's great that Everly Well has been known as the brand for that. But honestly, we're offering a test that has been around for decades and needs to be used in the right way.

And if we can take the lead in educating people on what that should be, then we'll do that. What category of tests do you think is the biggest opportunity? What we call it sexual health, STIs. And there's several reasons for that. One, right now our tests are too highly priced because the lab itself is expensive for us to run the test. So we, I mean right now our single marker STDs are a really good price between $39 and $49. It's also HSA and FSA covered. So for some people that's a great solution. But many people for obvious reasons want a comprehensive test.

And that test is I think $2199. So, the leading company in this space for STIs? STIs. I think STIs. I think STDs. It's STIs. It's the clinical right. That's our old school, high school. Yeah. It's sexually transmitted infections is the correct nomenclature. We call it sexual health testing because we think that this is something people should just be very active about. So who's the biggest in the space for digital? For at home. Yeah. I would say it's probably us just from branding standpoint. There's a couple companies that specialize. I'm sorry, I mean, you guys are doing it.

Which to be clear should tell you how under resourced and served this opportunity is because there's. It could be like a multi billion dollar business. Yes. It could be a multi billion dollar opportunity. I'm going to again, if we're going to riff lots of other people can come into this space. There's a specific company that only does STI testing, but they haven't been well funded. They've struggled. And we really believe that this is not only how you can best close public health gaps. You also can get people on board to then use testing it from home over their lifetime for any other health issue as well.

People don't want to go into a clinic. You don't want to go. Period. Right. So, if you have a solution, you actually can not only get your results, but then you can diagnose and treat through an independent physician. If you have a positive, if it's a relevant STI that can be treated. So it's a full service solution. And what you're looking at right now is we have a really good business, but if you look at the price sensitivity, there's a certain age group that's going to be willing to pay 250 to go get a test versus going to a clinic and potentially for free.

Are you requiring customers properly on first touch or do you hope to lose money on them on the first touch and then hopefully... Profitably on first touch. But that is, for me, we're in Austin. I'm a first time founder. We're building a sustainable business. We didn't go out and raise money on this premise of just negative contribution margin and then hoping to sell people later down the road. Is this your channel? No, wait, search. Well, it depends. Search for different categories, but search has a ceiling. It does have a ceiling even with STI testing. If you search STD because online, you need that shit right now.

Right. So for that category, certainly search is great for us, but Facebook slash Instagram was for a long time our largest acquisition channel. Both by force and by proactively moving away, we have really diversified, which has been a good move for our business. So is that on TV now? Some TV, we've had mixed success with, again, because we are on this profitable unit economics from the beginning play, when we can't fully measure attribution and ROI on first purchase, sometimes it's hard for us to want to invest. So we've had mixed success with TV, but we do believe it's important for brand building and category education.

Is all that 50 million going into marketing spend? No. No. Engineering, product, clinical. A lot of it goes into clinical and medical affairs. But you're not doing the clinical. So what's the, is the kit making sure the kit is as robust as you hear that? We have a regulatory and compliance team that ensures that either the lab partners we're working with or new lab partners that we're making sure that they're meeting the highest quality standards. We're starting our own research studies to prove outcome data, which will take time, but we think is really important. We do have obviously a healthy paid marketing budget, but we're trying to hire more in house around content SEO, organic and those pieces as we start to actually build out like a healthy marketing engine and not just be dependent on this like paid social thing that we were the last few years.

Should we bootstrap this? No. And that I think is a really. I feel like you would have if you could have. I would have if I could have. It's a really important question though. Go ahead. If you said like you're a marketing company, I'm like, oh, okay. So there's white label this thing. Right. You see it, put this cute millennial pink on it and then just start buying traffic. Where's the, I mean, that's, that's how simple it sounds. What was the worst of the challenges beyond the like, you know, the traffic to any page? And order this like product.

Right. So we don't white label. We actually fully end to end construct and brand our kits. And really what the lab does is run the sample. That's the goal of the lab. But there's also a really complex product from an engineering standpoint. So not only creating obviously what is somewhat basic an ecommerce site, but then a results platform that is able to speak with a third party physician network translate lab results that were often really messy and then be able to say that in a meaningful way to come to consumers. And five years ago that was not as easy from a like a UX standpoint as it is today.

So a doctor interprets all the results of independent position. Why couldn't they do something where they just say like the normal ranges and if you are in range or out of range. So I use wellness effects and they just say like, you, they also use a doctor. Yeah. It's for regulatory reasons. It's to make sure that you basically have a doctor in the process of saying, okay, I'm sure that this test is appropriate for you. I've made sure that if there are critical values. So for example, if you took our STI test and you had an abnormal, you would have a physician call you and talk you through next steps and offer you a telemedicine consult.

Yeah, that wouldn't be right. And so there, there are checks and balances in place. You don't always have to interact with the doctor if it's just a normal result. But there's certain like levels of escalation. So it is similar to wellness effects. It's home kits and wellness effects really kind of stayed on the quantified self or brand and never was able to scale. Business totally fizzled. Yeah. Yeah. It's still out there. It's all right. I use it, but it's not like that successful. But it's interesting. I mean, there've been a lot of companies, many, especially after Shark Tank.

I would put it in the two dozen range that launch an Instagram, create a pretty logo, have a kit and then about six months to 12 months later, you never hear from them again. And it does speak to the power of brand marketing and experience. I mean, our NPS is a 60. We have a world class customer base. I think in this case, first mover advantage really helped us in the category. It doesn't cause us to keep winning, but it mattered a lot here. So I'm not super savvy. 60, I thought 60 would be sort of like.

It all depends on what you compare it to. You have to compare it to others that are similar to yours. So if you're a bank and you have a 60 NPS, you're the best thing on earth. If you're a 60, but you're like a movie, then like half. Yeah, exactly. World class would be like 80 or above, right? So certainly it's below that. But I think how we view it is we look at other healthcare services and most are around a zero to a negative. Don't measure. Right. Right. And so we feel good about it.

Product rating is four and a half out of five stars on average. And so we do look at that and say, okay, this has to be qualified. It's a very favorable VC metric, one that I think has sometimes limited action ability or limited kind of data driven decision making around what do you do with it? But we like it in terms of saying, okay, just benchmark where are we? Right. So when you were starting this and something my sister was managing, my wife was managing something, and you have this idea, you're sitting at Deloitte and you have this personal experience where you do this test and you're like, this is crappy.

And that's what I'll call like every entrepreneur has the stated story, which is like, I was trying to get a test and I just was so frustrated and therefore I decided to create a solution. And behind the state of stories, like more of the real story, our audience is very entrepreneurial and they fuel this on a daily basis. They have these ideas. They also have doubts. They want to vet the idea. So tell me like that from the moment you had the idea that first couple of weeks, what was going through your mind? What were you doing? What got you over the point where you're like, okay, I'm actually going to get a test.

I'm actually going to do this. Yeah. I think this is important because it is the real story. Right. So I'm like, oh, I just had this idea and I, you know, we moved to Austin and a U Hall. All those things are true. But there's a few things, my husband and I and our dog, there's a few things that I think are important. It's not like I woke up one day and was like, oh, I'm going to go do this crazy thing. So I did go to Harvard and I was in this weird time. It was during the recession in 2009 when everybody in my class and the class above me were becoming entrepreneurs.

And so you had rent the runway, you had birch box, you had guilt a few years before, stitch fix, Oscar. I had two unicorn founders in my section alone. And at the time, a grab taxi out of Korea and then who was, oh, coupang, both in my section. Right. I didn't feel that unique, but I was being exposed to this day in and day out. And so I had this kind of roadmap for how to go about it once I started thinking about becoming an entrepreneur. And so I, the reality is I probably spent two years on the weekends in my spare time, not making any money, but going through different industries, different business models, advising different companies on their business plans and seeing like what would really stick.

Yeah. Well, that makes me so safe. I do, but it's really like, I look back. It's kind of boring. I'm like, travel, I don't know. I will, I will send it, but it's, it's like, I would be very literal in how I would go about evaluating all these ideas. And honestly, Everlywell was probably the craziest and the worst of the ideas for me to go and actually do, given my background. What about the other one? No, I mean, it was like travel, luxury resale, something like what the real, real is doing. I mean, house decorating curation online, like all kinds of different spaces where there's probably opportunity in any of those that you do it the right way.

Yeah. Well, it's on, to be clear, it's, I don't know if I took an idea from them or if I actually came up with it, but, but, you know, the match with Everlywell was not necessarily one where you'd be like, oh, right. It was not obvious, but it was the one where like, I realized really early on, this is a decade long thing. So if it actually works, you're in it for a long time. So you had to be passionate after you did this exercise to sort of start a new career. No, it was a couple of years.

I mean, until I had this health experience in 2015, and then I kind of matched the two together. So this was early 2015. I ended up incorporating the company June 18th, 2015. And then I left my job in August. And did you think of yourself as an entrepreneur? You said you were on the corporate path, but it sounds like you had dabbled in the idea of being an entrepreneur. I had dabbled. I didn't. Both my parents are lawyers. I didn't realize one that being an entrepreneur was actually a career choice and a path that you could become good at.

That didn't necessarily mean financial success, but you could be a serial entrepreneur and actually make that a career. And I also, frankly, didn't have a lot of confidence. So it was interesting at Harvard because I kind of looked around and thought, I think I'm just as smart as all these people who are like really founding successful companies. So maybe I can do it too. And I honestly did it just to see if I could do it. I never, like I truly couldn't even imagine having made a million dollars in sales. And so I'm not sure I necessarily thought about what it would look like today.

I just thought it was a really big opportunity and something that I wanted to see if I could go do. And that was how I made the decision is I thought I'm passionate. I think it's a major thing. I was in the FinTech space and I thought that was already really oversaturated by 2015. There's tons of apps, et cetera. And so I knew that this was an area that I didn't care about. I know, turns out I was a little wrong about that. But and I do think Wellness FX is an example where I think they were just ahead of their time.

They were too early on the curve. Right? And then... I think they started or like scientists or something like that. Or they're in the industry. Right. I actually think that's a weakness. You have to kind of be a marketer first. Right. Or you don't have to be. If it's a consumer brand. You have to have that part of you. You have to be aggressive. Right. You were an outsider, right? Yes. In this industry. Completely. What opportunities do you have? What opportunities have you uncovered where you tell people, man, just so you know, like, there's this huge problem in this industry, I think, to be solved.

Or other adjacent things. Yes. Because I'm a total outsider. But when I hear about the deceptive criticism, like, if you can solve an example of a problem, it's so easy to crush it. Price transparency, which may seem obvious. And I think there's a lot of companies that talk about in healthcare doing price transparency, but they don't actually do it, and even the digital startups trying to do it, they can't actually tell you what something will cost in healthcare. So we just go outside of insurance so that we can actually tell people what something will cost.

But if you were able to do this in a really big way and say, hey, we can accurately tell you your cost commitment for this service, I think you would crush it. Or within the insurance system. Within insurance, but I think there is a much, much larger growing acceptance of consumers who are happy to pay for something in healthcare as long as they know what they're going to get and what it costs. And so I don't know that it has to be with insurance. You also have this HSA and FSA space that's exploding in terms of people on FSA and HSA plans and then what they're using those dollars for.

I think there's an interesting play there. What does that look like, what's an example of a company? For what happened? Yeah. Oh. That's okay, that's what we do. And if you could be a, so if you had physicians and you said, okay, I'm going to have you pay $50 anytime you see the physician, we're going to own a pharmacy and any of your drugs are going to be transparently priced and you can't use a coupon. Everything is the same price and it's all generic. And then if you say, okay, and then I want to be able to get testing done and then they can tell you the pricing on that.

But here's the problem with it, you have to actually own the supply chain and the services chain. You have to be vertically integrated to do this because otherwise I know, but my point is you almost build a system external to the system and you can do this at affordable pricing. The reason healthcare is so expensive is because you're adding cost into the system through the insurers and those contracts, then when you get the bills, you're getting the bill for whatever they didn't want to cover, but that was intent like the provider billed the insurance company what they had hoped the insurance company would pay, not at all what it cost.

What else? In healthcare? In healthcare, whatever. The thing is that you discovered along the way, for example, when we started our company we realized how like paying freelancers were this, what I didn't know how hard that was. So like along the way where you were your entrepreneur, are you the type of people that was after the site? Oh, I have a list. Yeah, but some of them get stopped. So for example, like three years ago, two years ago on Black Friday, we had a huge bunch of compliance limits with our banking system on spend in Facebook.

So I was like, gosh, I wish there was a product where you could actually get like a cash advance for social media advertising. Now we're big enough to where we don't have to use a product like a Braxara. Or like Clear Bank would do it. But at that time, if those solutions had been around, we absolutely would have been able to take advantage of them. And then of course they came out and I was like, oh, that would have been a really good idea. But we really hit a bunch of challenges with that and it really can bring down businesses.

And then I think other places are, how do you make, as you think about doing a startup, the amount of time we spend on contracts and HR and legal and templatizing, I mean there's so much cost in the system that I would love to take out of it. In healthcare and in highly regulated industries, it's really hard to do things quick, dirty and cheap. So you can actually really see that as a thing and that kind of way.
