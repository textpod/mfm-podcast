# From Broke At 26 To $100 Million Net Worth By 31 (Alex Hormozi Interview)

Date: 02/11/2022

Duration: 1 hours, 12 minutes, 46 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

I have come to accept that I love working and I don't need to judge myself for that or or take in other people's judgment on how much I should quote do Like this is my life and this is what I like doing Because I never heard of you before and I was like a this guy's popping up all over my youtube all of a sudden What the hell is going on and b he's saying that this gym? I don't know. I called it a course which actually is incorrect. I was there's like one thing that I could make just for the almost for the audience's sake because like we're we're much closer to what a franchise would be um, and Overall in the very beginning that was what the big decision was like am I gonna go the franchise route because I had six working locations I was 26 years old And they you know they worked and that's what I meant was like you should stop owning all these gyms You need to license the model out and so that was when I kind of transitioned from b to c to b to b Um, what you might not know is that for two years actually because I wasn't confident I was like I know works in my six markets I was like but does it work in all of these markets? So my wife and I actually did 32 gym turnarounds in the next two years So we'd fly out in person fix their pricing change how they did their layout change their sale Like a consultant like like a management consultant for a hundred.

It's exactly that and then um from there We you know, we figured out we cleaned it up to just like completely dial it in um, and then I would love to say with some stroke of brilliance of like and then in my master plan. I decided to start licensing um, that was not what happened, uh, we ended up Doing these launches and the flaw of the business model was that I didn't control the fulfillment So we would go in we would charge nothing It was pure performance we'd fly in and I would charge 100 of the upfront cash collected Uh, that we would do while we were there So we averaged about a hundred thousand dollars in cash collected in 21 days And that's what we would average per gym that we'd come into.

So that means each gym is making an incremental hundred grand a month From your so if I were launching eight gyms in one month, we would make 800 thousand dollars. You got it, right? Oh, that and this was when the model before you were like exactly doing gym And so what ended up happening though was like and it started scaling really quick This is this is the game like this is what I need to be doing. This is awesome And they didn't have to spend money on ads. They like they did literally nothing They gave me a place to go market itself is basically what happened.

And so What happens we would dip out and then all these customers that we sold would then be fulfilled by a facility that was struggling Because that's what they called us So they typically had pretty poor product and I didn't have the bandwidth to stay there for six weeks on top of that and Retrain trainers and show them how to set up like I didn't have the time to do because we're marketing so most times were there and so Anyways, we would fly out and then what happened in an unfortunate percentage They basically were like, hey, you signed up and paid this guy $500.

I would give you the same thing for $200 refund with him and just sign up and I'll do everything through me And so within a matter of months, I had like $150,000 in refunds between like three facilities because they talked to each other and then I was like fuck And I already incurred the cost of marketing the flight the sales guy the hotel the rental car everything What was the name of this gym franchise? This this gym? I'm not sure this is just much. Okay, but I'll tell you this the original concept was gym rescue Um, it's like bar rescue.

That was kind of the idea But you said gym owners didn't want to be rescued bingo. So it's who doesn't want to get launched though, right? So it's gym launch even though you're already open. Um, it's a nice branding switch Uh, and so anyways, we were like, okay. This is not the model something's wrong here So I had to keep basically keep selling more every month to cover the refunds from the month before it was horrible very stressful Um, and so my wife had a little side training business that she had kept she was doing like three or four thousand dollars a month Um, and I was like, you know what? Screw the gym thing.

We know how to sell weight loss. Uh, you know direct to consumer. That's what we're good at I was like, why don't you become the face? I'll go in the back and I'll just run the you know I'll run the acquisition side and and we'll sell like 16 week transformations just over the phone And so we started doing that that that doesn't seem like a good idea. Does it? Right. I mean it it started work if 14 days we're doing a thousand bucks a day, uh, switching it and um, I just want to thought it's so crowded We're you know, I mean We're good like we're good at that.

You know, I mean like we that space we understand very well Um, and so we were able to do that and I was like, all right, the eight sales guys can come in We can do 8,000 a day selling these like the the the transformation programs Great. And so I had eight gyms that were supposed to launch the next month Um, and so I called them up and I was like, hey, we're not doing the thing we were doing before You know, you didn't pay us anything. So best of luck, you know, I mean basically it was kind of what it is and then um The first guy was like dude, I just refinanced my house.

I just maxed out my credit cards Like I need this my buddy like filled his gym up with you like I know your thing works Like I just need I please like help me and so, um, we he didn't hot and finally I was like, all right, man. Listen, I'll show you what to do I was like, but I'm not flying out there to save your ass if you can't close and he was like No, no, that's fine. That's fine. And he was like, well, how much and this that was like the magic moment where I was like Uh, and so just to show you where I was at the time, I picked the highest number I could think of With the intention of getting him to say no because I didn't want to do it And so I said $6,000 And he was like done and I was like, I just remember looking at the phone and be like holy shit $6,000 and so I hung up the phone and then I called the next guy who I was supposed to cancel on same spiel He was like, how much and I was like $8,000 and he was like, what are you giving these guys? So that you're giving them a playbook to sell in their market, which included what what did they do? But you probably actually didn't even know what you were going to give them.

Well, so we already had the entire the entire front end process was super super Lubricated so like these are the ads. These are the pages. Here's how you place them. Here's the targeting once they come in These are the five texts that you send. Here's how the reminder sequence works once they walk in the door Here's how you set up your lobby. Here's where you need to sit This is that's the stuff that a gym owner would send to a client who wants to get trained. It's not a course It's also not like eos. It's not like a back end operations thing.

It's it's like a marketing machine You you'd basically I licensed the acquisition. So we were the ads so it was ads that I was in Because I was like these ones work So I would run these ads that I had written to pages that I had built And I would and so what I was doing is what on on their url you basically Were you were a services business? Yes 100% were services business and the training component was like, okay Well, how do you sell so instead of getting one on one? I was like one the and so what I did was I actually gave them my internal sales training So it was this thing that I put my guys through and like a lot of it's kind of interesting because I fell into this where I think a lot of the the e learning space trying to create stuff to have stuff rather than creating As as as short of a time commitment to get someone from point A to point B Which is I needed to get a guy in who used to be selling shade mix from mlm and get him to close 500 dollar deals day one with two hours of training and so that training is what I gave to them So I already had everything I just didn't have the marketing part So all I did was I built the marketing part of the weekend because I already had the ads I didn't make a training for it, but the training for like how do you weigh them in? How do you do the food stuff? How do you like all that stuff already made because I had to do that during the gym rescue side? So I literally just added in how to run the ads and then the whole product was there and We helped them implement it implement the acquisition system within the business and the average gym collected $30,000 in additional cash in the first 30 days So we would do 100 But them not being as good as us still did 30,000 additional cash in the first 30 days And so the price point for the for the system was was 16 grand So they were stoked and then at that point we signed three year licensing agreements for 42,000 a year So they were like what else do you have? And what happened? And what do you break their gym because all of a sudden they go from 100 members to 250 in Two months and be like how do I hire trainers? How do I scale a sales team? How do I you know be like and then all of the other problems emerged and we already had done this because I had six gyms So I was like here's my ads for trainers.

Here's how I train them. Here's how we set up the classes to maximize square footage Here's how we do the ascensions into semi privates here. And so we just we just did the whole thing What can I google to see one of these gyms? I want to see like Like did you do that? I know you use click funnels. I think I could tell by the Favicon because I like click funnels too, but you what like can I google something to see one of your? clients one of your students. I don't know what you call them.

Yeah They're different because they're all they don't they don't take my brand So franchises system fee name, right? So we were just system and fee Otherwise I'd be operating as an illegal franchise And so let's zoom out for a second So you basically go from for those who don't know the story and I only barely know the story But the story is you open up a couple gyms yourself. So you open up a gym You get to six locations. Yeah You're sleeping on the gym floor, which is always, you know any business I do I'm just going to sleep in a garage at least one night so I could say that but uh, but you know, you know, maybe you did the real deal Or you actually had to sleep there.

I don't know Nine months. All right, so you're sleeping on the gym floor of nine months Uh, you end up getting six locations off of cash flow. So, you know, you're not like, you know getting a bunch of investors command or whatever And somehow some way you stumble into this like I don't know like a mastermind or a retreat by Russell Brunson The I don't know if he hosted or he was just there Um, who's the click funnels guy. How did you even get to that event? And then I want to ask you a couple questions about it Yeah, so for for avoidance of doubt I had two partners that after I had my successful gym.

Uh, one was the xcoo of broadcom Number two at broadcom ten billion dollar company Um, and the other guy had 22 tanning slums And so the broadcom guy brought in the tanning slum guy and was like, hey, let's scale this thing and I was like, awesome Long story short the partnership didn't work out Um, and so I ended up opening the next Three on my own and I opened up two more with them and then I ended up buying out Uh, both of them over time. So just did you have a job before this because you're only 29 32 I was a management consultant before that So I put my man And then and then started this um the question that you asked though originally was So how did you end up at this thing where it's at this hangout or this mastermind or this meeting where you Realize I'm in the wrong business.

I shouldn't be running gyms. I should be teaching other people how to run run their gyms, right? How did you even end up at that thing? It was it was and it was like russell's idea, right? At least I saw the video It was wonderful So the the the long story compress goes two years before I went to that mastermind I went to traffic and conversions summit because I knew I needed to like learn more about marketing and like I'm a gym. I'm like not internet market. I was like Not this is not my world, you know, I mean I was like I got to learn more about marketing So I'm gonna go to this marketing event So I go there and one of the side rooms was russell and he goes and pitches click phones But he couldn't actually do the stack because they weren't a lot of sales so he did his entire sales presentation and then literally just stopped before the buy button and I was like I want whatever I was like screw the gyms.

I want to learn how to do this stuff And then like most things because I couldn't buy there was nothing that I didn't I went back to my life for two years And that was it and then when I was having some sort of existential crisis because I was now 26 or 27 at the time Um, you know, all the gyms were you know, they were making money and I remember like texting one of my managers And I was like, hey, do you need anything? He was like, uh, I think we're good. I need some ink You know and I like order my amazon cinnamon and then I was done for the day And I was like trying to be useful But I needed to be useful So I google I was like, you know that Russell thing was really cool So out of the blue I google his name and the first link that comes up is are you one of my dream clients or something? Which was directly to his mastermind.

So I applied to the mastermind I got sold to the mastermind and transparently I should never have been sold to this mastermind It's for internet marketers and I was the only and it's like 30 grand, right? And I was the only brick and mortar business owner there They're like, oh, yeah tons of chipmotors And I've I've already told him we laugh about it But like anyways, I show up and I'm like, all right all the guys show their funnels and all the stuff and I was like Yeah, I own a bunch of gyms. I'm trying to get to 10.

I've got six. So that's kind of I'm just here to learn, you know Yeah, that's where I'm at. Yeah. Yeah. And so I walked through my acquisition process because we were we were getting 30 to 1 on the front end So 30 to 1 ltv to calculate from the first 30 days Right not including my my recurring on the back end and I walked through every which basically means Which means you're making 30 30 x what you were spending the best way on ads you get 30 dollars out on cash In the first month. Yeah, so the first one which is which is like a good for a lot of brands like 1 to 3 over a year would be our It was insane.

I mean, so it would cost us three dollars to get a lead and one out of five leads would give us 500 dollars And the reason that it wasn't more than 30 to 1 is that that's me giving the average with the sales guys But like when we ran it and I was selling and we were working leads like we get a hundred It was insane. So anyways, he saw these numbers and was like what is going on um And so anyways, I walked through and he said the sentence that changed my life, which was Alex, um You shouldn't be running gyms.

You should be showing Jim owners exactly what you showed me and right now You're in a level two opportunity with a level 10 skill set And that was those were the exact words that he said to me and it honestly hit me like a ton of bricks is I was like This is my vision united fitness. We're gonna be americans next gym. We're gonna make him very healthy like we've got this and um But you know, I he made more money than me at the time And so I was like if I don't listen to someone's advice then why am I paying for it? Um, and I saw an interview with you and you said something that I've had this exact moment before which is you meet people who are doing You know on whatever the scoreboard is They're they're they're richer their business is bigger their valuations higher.

They're younger whatever so they're more successful quote unquote and uh You meet them and you're like All right, there's nothing More special about them than me. Okay. So that's the first realization. I want what they have and they're not They don't have something I don't all right. So then you know, how do I do this? And it seems to me like that's what kind of shattered the glass of that whole like business plan that you had was that realization Is that right? Yeah, 100% I mean, I didn't even know what an opportunity vehicle was I was like, what do you mean? He was like you should like and I didn't I same was that Same Yeah, I remember I remember what I did though with that bet either Yeah, well, I mean I've I defined that now is the number of potential units to be sold and the gross margin per unit possible So it's just one times the other and then the third multiplier would be Supply demand dynamics within the space So like if I were to try to get into telecom Amazing tam amazing potential gross profit per unit sold terrible supply demand ratio for me to enter Right, so it's like how do I measure the opportunity vehicle? So those are the three that I used to measure that vehicle and so in this instance Uh, he was like, okay, you have all these gems that you can sell Uh, you have a huge and the big one that he saw was like the amount of potential gross margin per unit sold was enormous Right and so for context our second year of businesses in the licensing business.

We did 26 million top lines 17 million in ibida amazing Say those numbers again. It was 25.9 million in top line and 17 million in ibida First I've got a bunch of questions about that. That was a near one You said Okay, first of all, what made you you said that you were getting this 30 to 1 Uh ltv the cack what what were you doing? That was so good. Just good copywriting. Are you just a good salesperson on the phone? What was so good about you? Well first off facebook was way cheaper in 2013 I mean when this whole thing started, right? So I mean like just the cost per lead was insane the percentage of people would convert a landing page was higher Everything was more responsive, etc But from uh from from like what we were doing is we were offering an irresistible offer So we had a free six week challenge is what we offer people when they would come in We'd walk them through you know what the program was etc And then the the shtick and the reason it was so cool and compelling was that if they lost 20 pounds In six weeks we'd give them the entire amount of money back And that's what made it so cool and that's why we got crazy results We had like 70 80 success rates, which for a weight loss program is insane And it's because people were basically wagering money Um, and that was because I didn't know that like wagers are managed by lotteries and like I did I just was like you put 500 bucks down you lose the weight you get it back But the the reason it works so well is that someone come in so I'd pay I'll walk you through the math so Let's say at this point I'm probably paying 10 bucks, you know cpm so like And you know, so I'm getting and probably like 4 5 ctrs because it was like back then so I'm getting 50 clicks for 10 bucks, right? I'm like, okay, and now my landing page is converting half Right, so like it was it was just you know like bonkers like and that's why some of these in some markets We're getting 25 set leads, you know, I mean in some markets like the highest markets back then were like five bucks Right, and so you've got an average cost per lead of like two dollars, which was not you're getting what their phone number Was that yeah name phone or email? um And so from there we'd schedule usually like 50 to 70 percent of those people half of them would show and then we'd close Um and depend on you know the skill the sales guy the average gym closes 35 percent our team averaged about 50 when layla and I sold We averaged 80 um And so there's a big range there, but we'd collect the cash up front for 500 bucks and then 24 hours later They'd come in for nutrition consultation, which is complimentary.

We'd average 200 dollars a ticket in supplements You know a creatine pre workout, etc that we'd sell them right after that so we get another 200 pop Three weeks later what we do is say hey Listen, you lost 12 pounds sandy. Um Is that your ultimate goal and then she would be like well no I want to like get an amazing shape and blah blah blah We're like all right, so you understand that it's not about the six weeks It's about six years from now right and she would say yes, then I'd be like congratulations.

You won the challenge You've got the point of this and so what I want to do is I'm aligned with your long term goal too So what I do is because you won the challenge and take that 500 dollars I want to spread it over the next year so you get a discount for doing it so we can align with your goal Fair enough. You said sure three weeks after that she gets billed for her first billing So if you follow the money 500 200, then she gets billed right for the EFT even though she won the challenge Right, right.

Yeah, and then it's an amazing six weeks after that We'd say hey, wouldn't you like to like have a little bit more attention instead of being in this large group We can put you into a one on four scenario We can give you even more stuff. We can show you cooler more advanced exercises blah blah And so that was that was how we did it and were you just um But but then this part laid into the actual product that you really crushed it on right so Which was when you were doing 27 million in year two or whatever 20 something million with like 17 million in EBITDA A year two that product was the was gym launch, right? Yeah And what was that? What did that look like was it what software were you using and how did you package this like that's because I want to get really nerdy on this stuff Because I think about that.

I'm like that's a great idea But packaging a service is That's a challenge. That's interesting and I want to so I want to ask you what you did and then I'm going to ask you What other industries would you do it for so I mean that's what acquisition not commas So it's like it's exactly that like I know how to do this within a within a niche so like B2B services It's someone's like I know how to help a lawyer make more money with their law firm I know how to help a bookkeeper make more money with their bookkeeping business I know how to help hair salon, you know people make more money with their salons like that's what I'm looking for That's what I'm looking for is niche e learning slash service companies Um that we can invest in our good friend jack butcher has a phrase called Build once sell twice and that's basically what you were doing You were like people who were selling one to one They had to sell then do sell and do you were like no f that we're gonna build once sell a bunch of times And and that like process is what I'm asking about that's interesting.

Yeah, I mean That was when I'm sure you're familiar with the volks and other year on Twitter. Um Like I I kind of fell into like it's like you realize why you start making money Like I'd love to say it was some master plan like you realize later why something works a while It's like I had zero incremental cost. I was selling cars over the phone and I had no cost of goods like it was insane Um, and so we basically would onboard people, you know, we had a concierge service back then this is I mean It's five years ago, you know, it's been it's been a while Um, but we do an onboarding process.

We kick their ads off. We basically checking with them We had calls every single day. So I would hop on a call with every new customer every day I did is a group call But I was always available and then we had a 35 person tech support team that would help them with like the pixels And setting the landing pages up and all that kind of stuff And so because that was that that was the issue they would get stuck with was the tech So they could understand the sales. They could understand the nutrition stuff They got both of those things for the most part the tech is where they struggled So we really ramped up like our implementation help Um, and then on the strategy side, I would be there every day to take calls and I took 400 calls over the first year Um And so like that was kind of how we did the Futhoma And then but it was like a set of videos.

Yeah A set of videos too much as long with like a file a folder of files Yeah, it'd be like here's how you set up that, you know, I'd be like, here's why you set up the lobby this way This is what they need to see when they walk in you have them sit down here. Give them this iPad Here's the download for the the swipe file of the presentation that they should be leafing through before they come into the office When you like when you're ready say these things make this joke do this thing when you come inside Like sit on the corner.

Don't sit across from them because it seems confrontational Have them step on the scale make sure they step on it make sure they look at the weight Then she cries and you're like, okay sit down now. Listen. We're here to help you. Let's figure this out What have you done? So, you know, I mean like it was very scripted. So it's like here's the video explaining it Here's the script that does it and then here's six examples of guys in different gyms with different styles of selling Because that's one of the things that like we started to learn early on is that I was attracting guys Originally like in my team.

I just had everybody sell my way more or less Right and then I realized that a lot of people over time as I learned more about sales like People have different styles of selling and they're just as effective. Some people are more, you know, very analytical in terms of like their approach Like make basically make a logical argument. Some people are just very emotion driven Some people just do it off the poor like and so I show different styles of selling but still following the same framework And so we went away from a scripted process to more of a question based framework Which is what we've pretty much stuck with since then and if somebody wants to get good at selling What uh, like, you know, there's a Go out there and you know, try to sell a thousand times.

It's one way to get get better But if you wanted to improve your rate of learning what books courses Whatever what what youtube videos? Like do you remember that like that really clicked for me and that was like kind of like a game changing Uh thing for me and getting better at selling. I've relatively stronger beliefs about the topic Um, so I think first off a lot of people read books before they start selling and I've thought a lot about it And I don't think that's the right path Because you don't know what they're talking about.

Yeah, like you only know like what the concept of building rapport is until you've not Have rapport and like oh Okay, now I understand how this works, but like until you like until you Confront the reality like you can't you can't bucket the knowledge into something that's actionable So I'm a part of doing first Realizing the deficiencies and then going to find the information now to match the the the real life scenarios that you have encountered um The second part of the question is like which books or things like made things click so, um There's one moment that made things click which was I said this in the book saying which is like make people offer So good that feel stupid saying no, which was the secret of selling right is like if you just make it so good That they won't say no that it makes your job a hundred times easier And so I did work really hard on that side to make my job easier Yeah, and I agree with that my problem when I I'm a copywriter Former self talk copywriter and I know I know all about that, but I'm like Uh, if people want to refund this isn't going to be a pain in the butt Like if like in order to make this like in order to make an offer irresistible You could you could go a couple different routes, but one of them is you just do lots of stuff and when I think about that route I'm like, oh my god, that's gonna be a lot of work.

I don't know if I can actually execute on that What's an example of that? So give an example of where you see people with a kind of substandard offer and how you would give me and how you would switch it to Be a more irresistible offer. I mean a simple one we did within the agency space in the software company that we started Um, was we helped them transition from a retainer model to a paid performance model? So that was an implied guarantee and we just said listen pay us one time up front which by the way for most of them Was what their ltv was because most of them sucked so it's like if you're charging $1,500 a month, which would be Probably the standard small business B2B, you know, I'd say commoditized price point for generic lead gen Um, they're charging 1500 bucks a month.

We said hey charge your person $5,000 up front They want and say you'll never charge them again unless someone walks in the door And so they'll cover the ad spend after that and you don't get any percentage of it unless someone walks in the door so you generate the leads and work the leads and when the person shows up you charge x and That was based on a pricing survey that we ran internally to our customers where I said if we worked your leads for you um, what would you uh Be willing to pay as a flat rate and so there was a big pricing curve and the the concentration of like 75 percent We're willing to pay between 300 and 400 dollars a month for that just as a flat service and I was like, okay Now I asked the exact same scenario same results same everything Later on in the survey and I said if we just said hey Uh pay per show what would you be willing to pay for somebody who walks in the door? For the same exact performance.

They're willing to pay four times as much and so I said well, I'll be why don't we price it that way? And so we did it on a paper show model and so that's what we transitioned and it also makes it way easier to sell We could cash flow the acquisition because we were making the ltv that we were not we but like the agencies could make Normally upfront day one in cash and what's cooler is then the first 30 days they had people show up So they get cash up front and then in the first 30 days They're still getting cash that they can use to finance the acquisition to the customer, right? And so that's a much more irresistible offer from a chiropractor.

It's like well, how do I know it's gonna work? It's like you pay us one time just get all the shit set up and then from this point going forward only when someone shows up you have to pay And so people understand this you said software company and so I looked I mean I watch a lot of your videos So I know this but you basically had like three or four or five businesses The first one was this main one which was gym launch and that was doing like 30 40 50 million down to 26 So we did 6.8

million Year one that was the hybrid between me doing gym rescue and transitioning to the licensing model So about halfway through year one. I was like this model is not working And so we flipped it and then that's when we shot out like a gun like the first month We did 120 the next month. I think we did like two something then it was 360 then 480 Then 780 then a million then million two million five like that was literally the next like six months And so that crossed us into the second year of business and then that year we did Uh 26 million So we did 6.8

with 3 million in EBITDA year year one uh the second year we did uh 20 25.9 with 17 million And then year three and this is why I'm a big advocate and this is maybe just my own deficiency But um, we did 37 million top line 13.4 million in EBITDA So Alex made a big fuck up um and was like hey I because at this point even though it sound like this was short period of time I was like I had heard that I could sell this for like a hundred million dollars. I was like fuck.

Yeah, let's do that um Blowball a three year fucking journey, but um Um anyways, and there's this flu that went around people lost their minds. It didn't affect the gym space at all. That was good. Um, I'm joking uh, so so anyways, uh, we started the supplement company prestige labs in december of in december of 18 And you're basically selling supplements to your clients. Well through the clients So they never actually purchased from us directly what we did was we created a dropshipping model Because they don't issue that small business owners have is cash flow.

So I said what we did was we sent out retail kits That had 130 bottles on them or empty So the retail kit was like a hundred bucks and they could stock their whole wall because all consumer research shows that like the more Stock the wall is the more likely they are to purchase and they would only have one sampler of all of them out And then we sent them a kiosk with uh with an amazon uh Fire on it right that was preloaded with their affiliate links. So someone would try it Oh my god, and they would make the purchase right there and we'd say hey, this is so much better because now to go straight to your door Stuff, you don't need to take it home with you and better yet You won't miss a month because it'll automatically ship to you So we gave the gyms a second recurring revenue stream Through the supplement.

So when someone walks in when I was telling you earlier like Some service and we sold product we'd sell two eft. So that's the gym word for electronic fund transfers or recurring revenue So we'd sell them a service recurring and then we'd sell them a product recurring So that we'd have two different streams that would come in the nice thing with the product recurring is that there was no There's no operational drag for the gym. They don't have to do anything They just have to make the one sale one time and they're going to make 80 bucks a month From that point going forward pure profit for them like just straight to the bottom line and so what you know interestingly Uh a lot of gyms make more money selling the supplements they did on their service because the service is low margin But the the product was like almost all margin for them and we paid really aggressively so we paid 40 percent Um commission to them because they were paying for the cost of acquisition and doing the sale So I said, you know, you guys should get disproportion rewarded in the first month.

We launched that Uh, so we beta launched in december and then january of 2019 Is when it kind of officially launched in the first month we did 1.7 million and so um because I figured I was like, okay If we've got you know 800 active gyms if each of those guys sells and it was actually under my projections because I was like we're gonna be You know so wealthy. I was like if all of these guys just sell $5,000 a month I was like, we'll do a million a week. Um, it didn't work out that way But uh, we ended up doing that year 37 But my licensing business came down and I think went to like 20 Ish and then the supplement company for like 17 And part of the reason the oopsie that I did was too big oopsies number one was I started a second active company When I already have one which to me I think was a mistake Uh, given the skills that I had at the time and then the second uh oopsie was that because I thought the potential Acquire who to want lower churn, which is true Um, I lowered the price and so I thought that if I lowered the price that would get more people to stick And so I cut my top line price by 25 and so absolutely no change and just lost What what what was it and what did you reduce it to? It went from uh, the it went from 800 a week Which is the licensing uh on the back end to 600 a week What's 800 a week times 52? I don't even like what's the annual cost? was it So it cost 42 grand to be uh a part of your What what do you call it part of your not court? Yeah, but what do you what's like the noun that you use to describe this? Uh, like your It's called legacy the people were called gym lords And so we would sell the launch as a front end program and then they would go into the continuity which was legacy So if you're if you're if you're following on from home for anyone in the podcast I copied the exact same model So I sold a six week defined end program for a lot of money and then I downsold the continuity because 16,000 for 16 weeks Is a thousand a week and so I said now you're going to get more for less for 800 a week You're going to get what you have before plus all this other stuff for less money than you were currently paying And they're like what a deal at the gym.

I said hey, it's $100 a week $600 And if you stay we're going to drop you from 250 a month to 200 a month because we'll take your 600 dollars And we'll spread it over uh 12 months We'll go $50 a month in credit and so then you get to 199 a month And so it was front end to liquidate the cost of acquisition So that I wouldn't need outside capital to occur customers And then the back end I would downsell the upsell so that we could keep the continuity and big Which is all like the most classic internet marketing shit Which like a lot of like tech startup stuff.

They don't do this in their fools for not doing it In tech startups, we do the opposite typically so we're saying hey, uh, we want to get you in we want to make you don't know us We don't know you let's make the cost of kind of trying so low So free free trial don't even put a credit card on file And they try to put the bar as low as possible. You did the exact opposite. You said, okay, I'm going to put Actually more friction up front. I'm going to ask for $500 or $16,000 a huge number up front And then over time I'm going to actually be selling you on more value for less cost Why do you think that works or why do you think that worked for you to to charge have such a big kind of Commit up front when you know, that's usually when people are you know hesitant.

I think there's a couple pieces Um, one is most software companies have funding not all but a lot of them have funding I did not have that and so I could not afford to be in the negative and incur Caught I didn't I couldn't have a burn rate burn. It was alexis bank account. So that wasn't going to work for me from a Psychological and behavioral standpoint. It always makes sense to me to sell someone when they're the most excited So you're the most excited day one before you've gone to your first workout because once you get your first workout You're like shit.

This is going to be work So and I'm going to have to start dieting and not eating the stuff I want Sell them when they're excited about the bikini and not about the tsa and the airplane They have to go through to get to Maui right and so I followed that and then the reason that we decreased cost over time Is because it's my belief that information decreases in value over time And so the longer someone has it an exposure to it the less valuable is you know marginally And so we try to accommodate that with the pricing and since our our gross margins were still basically 100% It still made sense for us So let me try something this might be a bust we can go back to the gym stuff This is a bust but let me try something you've said a couple things That I thought were really interesting nuggets.

I want to kind of rapid fire. Just say I'm gonna just quote you And I want you to riff on it for as long as you feel like doing and then we can switch to the next one All right, so I'm gonna take one of yours. Um Let's let's start with this one As an entrepreneur you never arrive. You just enter a new club as the smallest member The guy who lives above me Um is Andrew churn and he owns panda express 100 out right and they did 3.8 billion last year in top line revenue with a 26% net margin He took home $950 million in income And I was like I'm a peasant.

That's all that that's all this means. You know what I mean? That's all and so I wrote that right after um, I did the math on how much he was taking home And he's been doing this for 45 years. He owns this building the cosmo Uh, and so he he owns the the waldoorff and he owns the cosmo. He was both building He just bought cosmo for 5.6 billion. He bought it from blackstone people were trying to get acquired by blackstone He bought it from blackstone So like you know what I mean? There's Vegas that was I mean, I'm sure you like Wait, is that are you in austin? Is that no, I mean, I'm in Vegas Yeah, um, and so I I think you know as the margin utility of money goes down because you just don't eat anymore It just you know becomes whatever silly store word if that's meaningful to you and so it's like, all right Well, there's just a lot bigger games than I've been playing and I've been in a very small pond Let's let's do another one passive income is overrated.

We seek freedom But what we really want is options for engaging activities. What does that mean and How'd you come to that? So 2021, uh, we sold three companies. So we were like I didn't it was Interestingly, my cfo was the one who was really engaged in those activities and like I was not So I pretty much like took a really passive seat in 2021 Because I didn't want to really go start hardcore on on scaling acquisition.com Until that was done. And so I was bored out of which which three companies Allen so Allen prestige labs and gym watch So those are my three majority holdings right now.

I have all minority holding so between 20 and 33 percent are the holdings that we target for acquisition Um, and so I had this I don't want to say existential crisis, but more like I'm bored out of my mind I thought this is what I was always optimizing towards which was you know, quote freedom Which is like you're always you're always outsourcing all of your activities and buying your time back And then you have all your time back and you have nothing to do And I was like this sucks and I look back on the times of when I was building into those companies with lots of nostalgia And I was like man, that was like some of the happiest times of my life and so That of them in this position I'm getting back into the game and like right now we're heavily recruiting like we're two days a week We're just doing interviews to build the core team out and um, I honestly am.

I'm happy as fuck doing this And so it's like but the difference between this time and last time is that I have the option to do it that I'm choosing rather than Uh, because if I didn't have this business, I wouldn't have the option to work So I had to create the option for myself And so it was like for me the shift was going from freedom to optionality at least for as I had to understand the work Right first you start you do what you have to do to pay for life Then you take that money you buy back your time But then you need to spend your time on the thing you want And acquisition.com

is basically you're buying other you're going to buy businesses and Deploy your model. What are you what are you doing 100%? Yeah, so we buy an interest in we buy them at already interested in the business Um, and we deploy the model. I mean that's that's what we do the business is somebody who's doing like what you did for gyms They're doing it for legal or hair salons or something else or photographers. That's your latest, right? Yeah That was that was the fourth company that one we still we have a 20% interest in that company And you say hey, I just had a business just like this and I scaled it up I know what it's going to take for you to go national with your kind of like with your business Let me take a minority seat and uh, let me like help you grow this thing.

Yep That's a great model. What niche is interest you? I mean really it's just services like I and it's it's silly because like everybody's like really hot on software and There's all the valuations and stuff, but like I may just be a simpleton which is very possible. Um, I just like high cash flow businesses. So I just really like Service businesses are super malleable. I can chase price points. I can change a product I can change client experience without a ton of dev work or engineer or UX and and I just like that I feel like they're simple businesses.

It's very easy to get tons of margin in them If you know how to you know deliver value and so right now the the four kind of they're all related But the four targets are e learning businesses that are in a niche uh brick and mortar chains that already have multiple successful locations So they're probably looking at do I do I go national and own them all which is what we we did with the photographer business So ironically we actually own we own all of them. Um, which is different with that one Which is different with that one, uh, which we have I think 13 locations and when we started we had one and that was like a year ago So like we're just it's it's an awesome business.

That one. I think it's going to be worth more than all the businesses that I put together Um, uh software as a service or tech enabled services More tech enabled services that could potentially have some mini, you know software component, but not as the the main thing necessarily um, and then uh, and there's a fourth one that I'm just forgetting because I'm on podcast So you you said that might be the best business what what people are going to be like photography? What what is it? So what does that do and why is it going to be such a good business? so It's a great business.

Um the It's children's photography first off. Um, it has an awesome mission. We donated a million dollars last year um to kids stuff, uh And so the founders are super mission driven The the short story is their daughter got told at school to shut up Um because she was stupid or something and she didn't talk for like nine months and so They couldn't figure out how to get her to talk again. And so what they did was they started taking their photographers So they started taking pictures Um and put it into like a story experience and read her a story where she was her own hero And so in the story that they put together for her She like gets her voice back and like whatever and so that actually like their daughter starts to talk again And so that's why they're like super mission driven around like the donation stuff that they do The actual business model itself is really really good.

Um, I mean people come in and we take you know take pictures And it's really about the it's called magic, you know a chain of fairies, but it's a magic magical storybook experience Um, and so it's kind of like the idea of like taking disney um and putting it You know in some in other areas You walk out with a book with you in it That's one of the products we sell there's And you're gonna now like teach photographers how to do that teach photographers Oh, I got it. So that so this business was interesting So he at the time when he came to me he had one location And he had I think about a hundred customers who were b2b Who were doing like some sort of like hybrid agency Business coaching thing And I really hated the model And I was like, well, how much extra does like a photographer studio make I'm not going to share the numbers.

I'll just say it was a lot um Uh, and I was like, how much you charge and he was like five grand and I was like, all right We're never doing that again. So how much does it cost open a photographer studio? And he was like a lot less than it makes and I was like, okay Well, why don't we just front all that and build them all? And so that's what we did Sean he uh, alex Maybe I don't remember how long ago. I think recent had a call The headline was like Grant Cardone just made me a billionaire or something like that.

It was like a funny headline And he did this he paid Grant Cardone 30 grand for an hour of time Oh, yeah, pretty crazy And basically on he record he youtube the call and on the call he basically You know how like you and I will talk to each other or our friends and you're like, hey, I'm in the middle of selling this company What do I do? And then you also be like, by the way, like here's my net worth portfolio Like is that enough like you just ask all these questions like, you know, like what do I do now? Like what's I have this like how much should I expect? You know like all these like the things that you asked like your rich uncle like as you're growing He asked all these questions and he was so transparent.

It was uncomfortable almost he said He was well look like right now. I've got 21 million dollars in the bank after this. I should have like 54 after taxes Um, and he like this is all on youtube. It's it's it's wild. Why are you so open about that? I think that's that's um, cool, but uh uncomfortable for you yeah, um I It feels like the right thing to do um, I think like what are the things I'm most afraid of and But usually they're the things that I should do and so it's like I'm afraid of saying this because I It because I know that when I say those numbers people can immediately judge me in one direction or the other But in my mind all the people that I want to talk to I think that's a really small number and so I feel insecure saying those numbers But I want to like I'm a big believer that like shame only exists in the darkness And so like if I can shed light on it, then I can hopefully quell some level of the insecurities that I have Yeah, but the pandex press guy wasn't doing that when he was 32 What are the numbers? Yeah, no like he he didn't like you're saying you think it's small or they they think it's small Um age is a fact age and liquidity are huge Um multiples to net worth so like the fact that you had that at age 30 And cash is way different than owning 10 restaurants It also seems like you know for your model with acquisition the more you go out there as The entrepreneur's friend and entrepreneurs helper and you provide a bunch of value by giving out free content And stuff like that then you're basically creating your own deal flow because of that right like people when they think God, what do I do with this business? I've learned so much from this guy.

Maybe I could reach out to him Maybe maybe acquisitions would be a good partner for me like as the next phase like To me, that's the model right? That's the why to me aside from like, you know Like what okay this podcast is similar in that sense, right? We go on here every week We risk getting canceled we risk getting judged as idiots for saying stupid things off the cuff about stuff We barely know about you know, we risk all kinds of stuff But the gain is a it's kind of fun to do it and b You get either people thanking you or opportunities come in your way and you're like all right net net I think that the combination of the the good feels and the good deals You know makes it worth it I would have to quote that the the big thing is like feels and deals that that's the mission and like this is Might be like my personal mission and I don't really understand the value of it because people do like mission statements and stuff But like I think people just put generic ones and they don't like resonate um Like my mission through acquisition.com

and really my life is like I want to document and share the best practices building built building wonderful businesses like that is what I want to do and I'm like I will die and the shit that I accumulate is irrelevant and so like It's a travesty to me that like Elon and Bezos and Warren like they they don't they didn't write any books like like that's I mean That's the point. You don't even like it's just for me for me. You don't mean that's real for me Uh is like sharing that um And so the businesses are just there to lend credence to what to to the books and the topics and the lessons and give me real stories to drive real fundamental truths home um and candidly to discover them as I go because like I mean, I'm horrified at the things that I I you know said five years ago that I thought were true But you know the only thing short of that is not saying anything which is is something that I consider every day of like Is this this is this is as least wrong as I can think of it currently, you know, and maybe I will think of it less wrong in the future where you um you seem like a grinder when you are building these businesses where you just like uh doing 80 hour 100 hour work weeks and what about now because you're like Yacht you're a huge you look like a bodybuilder.

So so like how did you balance like uh being fit and get married and You but I don't know you well, but you seem like you'd be grinding hard So my wife works in the business with me. So we are true 50 50 partners like It's very rare. I like I recognize how rare it is She actually is 100 matched with me and like should just as much be on this call because she runs the other half like she From a work standpoint, she has more output than I did She is the operator. So she builds the infrastructure.

She does the recruiting. She says the they are the HR stuff She does the culture. She like she does. I mean she runs everything Um, I just you know occasionally come up with a good idea and try and stick with it long enough Um to see it come true, but in terms of grinding We this is what we like I love business like I love this and there's nothing that really stimulates me like this And so I do as much of it as I can and if we want to go out to dinner we go out to dinner You know, but like worst word.

I was just saying we're single. So we don't have kids and so we work from like five ish to four ish, you know Um, and then you know, usually in the middle of the day We'll probably go to the gym for an hour or two and then come back and keep working and go out to dinner at night And that's that's kind of our lives you seem pretty um This isn't I would say I'm a little bit. I'm definitely this Sean has a little bit of it too like Manics not the right word, but like neurotic.

Maybe it's a better word. Um, where it's like, uh You there's something that's deep Rooted inside of you. That's kind of it's not like you want to do something necessarily. It feels like you're it's more compulsive Um, or obsessed you're obsessed about stuff, which I am as well Um We're if that's true, what's that rooted in? What are you trying to get done? So I think originally the drive was from just crippling insecurity and needing approval, right? Um, and then I think from like a behavioral conditioning standpoint, I Got immediate feedback that was positive and then I was conditioned to continue those actions now Uh, I continue to do them without the original catalyst that got them going to begin with So I don't I don't think I suffer, you know from the insecurities as much as I used to I'd say I'm probably 30% better than I was at the beginning and it might just be because I have this massive big pile of money That I can use as an emotional crutch to why I'm not a piece of shit um That would help I'm just being like, I mean if it were all in this period I'd find out how much actual growth I had or if I just compensated by circumstance and you know compensate for the deficiency I don't know you can send it to me and we'll we'll find out we'll see I let's run the experiment I like So there's the compulsion and like this last year.

I pretty much took off like I did not work that much um and so I saw the difference and like I Have I have come to accept that I love working and I don't need to judge myself for that or Or take in other people's judgment on how much I should quote do Like this is my life and this is what I like doing And their ideals that they've arbitrarily made up as what they define as balance are irrelevant to me Well, you said you took last year off. What'd you do? What'd you get up to? We went out to dinner every single night to a five star restaurant for seven straight months.

We went to I mean we we moved to vegas temporarily um, we traveled a lot Uh went to cabo went to scosta went to sedona went to flagstaff um Traveled all over um went out did did stuff um Felt felt honestly pretty empty like you can only eat so many times like there's just not a lot to do It feels good having that rest though. I mean when I sold my company Which was a year ago last week the first six six months I was like I need to decompress it felt good to have it and then and then I was like And I'm in that phase now where I'm like, all right now.

I'm ready for war again You you can't like I like you can't be in the trenches I think like or rather you need breaks from from being in the from being at war I think and it may be even phrasing it I'm just throwing this out there like phrasing it as instead of like a break as a shift in how you're thinking because like It's really like it's going from dirt to clouds, but I still think it's high leverage Activity, you know, I mean or like output. It's just a different type of output You said something on one of your videos that um, you're one of the only other people that I have heard say this phrase I use it a lot which is Yeah, I had a season like or this season i'm doing this or I had a season where I was really just focusing on x And that's been like a game changer for me my personal trainer and kind of coach He's like my mindset coach plus trainer.

He does this all the time or he's like he's like I'm in a season right now where I'm I'm just uh, he'll be like, you know, I'm I'm practicing not waiting And he's like hey comes up with these little themes or he'll be like right now I'm in a season where I'm gonna eat whatever I want And it's kind of like in the entrepreneurial world. It's like time boxing So I'm gonna give myself two hours to get this to don I'm gonna launch in the next two weeks no matter what right like I've used time boxing for productivity and now this season's thing it makes every like decision you're making less Heavy of a commit because you're like it's okay.

Yeah, there's yeah There's beginnings and ends and this season is gonna feel a little different just like winter feels different than summer That's how I use it. Do you do you use it like that? I just noticed you said that phrase 100% yeah, and maybe it's a fitness thing. I have no idea. Um, I I I've yeah, I have no ownership Yeah, I mean I I think about it in terms of entrepreneurial seasons Um, and I at least for me might have been like five year chunks And so this is gonna be my fourth season Um, and they've roughly been about the same length.

So I think that it probably takes me like three ish years to like Really see something through and then two years to figure out How I'm gonna transition from that thing or realize or monitor, you know, whatever Um, that's right. It's kind of like a pee cycle almost How much of your look do you think is a lot for your success? Counts for your success because your face are on a lot of ads and on your youtube videos It's like you looking jacked you've got this in a lot of videos You've got this badass handlebar mustache for the people listening not watching you look I don't know what your what your heritage is, but you've got like cool jet black hair.

You look like, uh I don't know you look like a like a like a like an italian lumberjack Persian like I don't know what it is Persian all right, there it is. Yeah, like you drive a you drive a g waggon, but there's an axe in the back So I read a book uh by ding canady Five years ago that said that people who have noticeable facial features are more easily Uh, recognized and remembered and so I read that and then I grew a handlebar mustache and um that actually actually I sold the likeness of the mustache with the company Um because it was still a core part of the branding like you know the events everyone would have stashes And it was like money, you know stat, you know stat cash money stash or whatever You know, there's a bunch of like hashtags.

You had to stop having your mustache after that Was that you had to stop having just a handlebar mustache because you sold it No, but they're allowed to use it. I got tired of After five years But what about like the speed because all right again for the what are you way? What are you? I'll tell you what are you way? You're huge. I'm 511 220 Okay, so uh just when you're getting getting big is it like do you think this is gonna look awesome in a now? Before he started internet marketing right you were built when you started the gym Because I saw a video or a photo of you like starting your first gym and you were already jacked so it's not like Well, I watch I was I've been working on my squat and I was trying to figure out how what I what I can make How what the gains I can get in three months and I came across an article that you had When you were in your early 20s, I bet and this article the gains that you had in like nine weeks That was the craziest shit.

I've ever seen What was it? Sean you got to like look at this article. That was natural I like I'll tell you because I'm on TRT now Um me too. So I was I was that was 100% daddy Um And no in the comments. They do not think that that is like trend much, you know, you know, I mean But the that training methodology is pretty much what I've done since then So I had a I had a roommate his name was Greg Knuckles. He's really big in the strength space Fucking amazing name. There's his real name.

Greg Knuckles. Yeah Yeah, and he's one of the two smartest people that I've ever met from a pure processing power standpoint like Sounds like a mafia guy. I mean, you know, he's you know, got a perfect SAT score when he was 14 Like very very bright, um, but also stupid strong Like when I met him, we were in our 20s and he was pulling 800 like Stupid strong and natural And so anyways, he was like, I read this research paper What if we had you lift six times a day, but for like 10 minutes each time and I was like Cool and I lived at the gym.

So I was like sure whatever. So I sent a timer and every 45 minutes I would go and do one set on three exercises then I'd go back to work Which side note is actually an amazing productivity hack because like I had this nice Timing like cadence and I got this nice like boost for my nervous system every 45 minutes to like wake back up And so I did that and that's when I gained just a tremendous amount of weight Um, but coupled that with another thing that he had done research on which was like a pure carbohydrate diet Um with no fat and so basically the efficiency of fat Conversion to fat that stored is almost 100 percent the efficiency of carbohydrate storage into fat is lower Um, and so if you don't have because you're gonna have a calorie surplus And so to give yourself a smaller percentage of that surplus that gets stored as fat You would want 100 of the surplus to be carbohydrate carbohydrates And so the idea was like I had you know 200 grams of protein and like 800 grams of carbs and basically zero fat Besides the yeah, I saw what you're eating.

It looked like it'd be awesome for a job It was horrible after that horrible anybody who's like it didn't work. I'm like just try eating that now The big caveat to this is like I have what I you know, I think I have elite genetics I think like dr. Cashew who's my closest friend. He's a biochemist. He's a national strong man He was like you have potato chip genetics. He's like you shouldn't give advice to people He's like you can just like drink coca cola and work out and like you'll have a sex pack So like I had that plus I was doing everything Maxed out like as I possibly could and like it was not sustainable like my knees were shot My elbows felt like shit like by the end I was sleeping terribly because I was I was bordering on overtraining um, but I put a ton of weight on and I put a ton of strength to all my main lifts and uh From there what I did was I dialed back the total volume, but I kept the split not to get into fitness stuff But instead of doing seven sets of every exercise every day Um, I just dialed it down to like five and then while I was reading that article while I was listening to your videos And I was like, oh man, this guy carries this shit over to everything.

I understand like it was super precise Very like well, obviously, I think what's interesting about you is you don't have a uh, or maybe you do but you've overcome it A self limiting belief that a lot of people have and you're like well, of course, this is gonna work You're gonna do this you're gonna do this you're gonna do this you're gonna do this and it's gonna be hard But that's the outcome is gonna be blank and and you here's the plan attack And you took that same process to business. Yeah, I could I could hear it in your voice when you're talking about business and fitness And that's why I thought it was cool.

Thanks Let's do like one thing you one of my favorite things from you is uh, these little tick tocks or shorts I see where you're giving like a sales tip or a little sales trick or whatever and um I would love for you. I think most people probably, you know, most people who are listening to this just You know the bell curve of people listening to this Probably have spent, you know, zero time trying to improve their sales and have not seen some of these things So I want to give them the opportunity where they don't got to go click and find this random tick tock that I'm talking about in the ocean of tick tock I want to role play a little bit.

Um, give us kind of like Um, give us an example of normal like here's the default way people are doing something and here's the rephrase of the reframe That has better results. Um, I would love to to give get two minutes of learning sales from Alex Sure and just as a quick caveat to complete the loop from like 40 minutes ago You said like what was the book or training or whatever that? So it's my belief if you look at belford, you look at bradley, you look at grant cardone some of the big sales trainers that are out there Almost all of them invariably have the same story which is I started selling and was the best guy on the team by a fucking mile And then I tried to figure out what I was doing and so I do think that some people Naturally based on their childhood their up brings their whatever or just have a higher proclivity for selling With a gift of gab and an empathy.

Yeah, and I think it carries over into how you recruit for selling too Because we've built a lot of sales teams and I actually have a very short Allowing for people to fail at sales cycle probably much shorter than most people And it's just because I've never had a killer sales person who didn't do pretty well the first week And so for me, we you know, we turn through this quickly But as a result of that the team is just killers and they know that so I like this quote from from grant cardone But he says, you know, my sales seems a dangerous place to work And um, I love that so in terms of uh, Sale stuff, I think that I think people don't know how People are really freaked out about the idea of selling right and so I think the first reframe is like you're not selling You're helping someone make a decision that's going to help themselves And the the the front part of that is that I do think that the number one predictor of good sales is conviction And so Fundamentally you have one person who should believe in something Another person who does not believe it yet and trust is the thing that transfers that conviction So if fundamentally there's the two things that you're going to do So if fundamentally there's the two things you need you need trust and you need conviction Most times salespeople don't have 100 trust.

I'm sorry 100 conviction. And so The also the idea of conviction as a binary is false. So it's not like I believe it or I don't believe it Is to what extent do I believe it right? And so that's why like in terms of if I want to improve a sales team I can do the drills which we do and that's like blocking tackling But the thing that really juices a sales team is hearing the testimonials of the people that they sold last week And what they're doing today and how their lives have changed and so I noticed this because on my sales teams when we were in person Whenever I did way out day, which is when everyone finished their challenges and everybody was crying and so excited I tried to stack as many sales appointments as I could while people were weighing out and during those days We closed like 100 because people were like dude.

How can you not think this works? It's right there And so the thing is is like you can either trick yourself Into having the right tone or you can train yourself And I think that it's much easier to trick yourself into it by just simply believing because if you talk if you truly believe in the product You will talk about it differently And so in terms of an understanding of selling if you need to have conviction and you need to have trust Trust is going to come from expertise and some level of rapport, right? And so I think that overarchingly To help someone sell we just have to ask the right questions to get someone to come to the conclusion of their own And so most sales conversations follow more or less the same framework If you know what you're doing Otherwise people are just chasing their tail and trying to chase the prospect to an outcome that the prospect doesn't know Like we've had this conversation a hundred times.

They have only had it once We should be the one knowing how this conversation is supposed to go, right? We should also come in with a massive advantage to how to have this conversation go the way we want it to because we do it on a fucking day, right? And so, you know big big front end pieces. It's like Why are they there? What's the problem? What have they done so far? understanding where they failed Seeing why our product is different from the things that they failed Asking for permission to explain about the product Explaining the product not in any way based on features But only based on the experiences that they will have as a result of it and using analogies to explain those experiences, right? And then and then having a close at the end which the the tick tock I think that you you references like a no base close and I think a lot of natural sales people do this anyways Like if I want something I'm like, hey, can you do this for me? I'm like, hey, would you mind and they say no? They don't I don't mind right like this natural communication dynamics that most people who naturally know how to persuade people or at least influence Do that on their own.

This is just retroactively looking at it saying what did I do different? Why is this different? and In terms of like overcoming because people are afraid of confrontation, right? That's what they're afraid of And so I believe that you can solve without ever having confrontation And you can do that with what I like to call childlike curiosity. And so if someone says Well, my husband's not going to approve that. I'm like Why wouldn't he? It would be like, huh, that's so interesting. Tell me more about that Rather than like, all right, let's like your husband's an asshole like that's not going to work because in arguments no one wins, right? And so you're like, why why would he think that because because I would think that he wants what's best for you, right? Yeah, he wants what's best.

Does he know you're struggling with this right now? Well, I mean, yeah, he knows I'm struggling with it Okay, so he wants us best for you. Notice you're struggling with it. So why do you think he would be opposed of solving something that that you're currently struggling with? The just so I understand would he be happier if you continue to struggle? Well, no, it's like, well great He'd just want sort of theAAAAA And so one way to deal with it is if thought happens sick I would be I do feel like And so I think sales is a lot to say, why were you like, you're adrenaline kicks in, sharp breathing faster, a spider flight.

So you got to be able to slow it down and be like, huh, that's crazy. I wouldn't have thought that. Okay, tell me more about that. And like, now you're interested and then they don't feel like you're combating them. They feel like you genuinely are interested and want to help them, which is what you should be doing because you should be selling them only if it makes sense. You're exhausting. You are full of like interesting insights. And like, it's like, you just, you, you, you just have, you have a, you know, a lot of shit and like you've clearly packaged us in really easy to understand ways.

It's almost exhausting listening because it's like every, it's like when you read a really good historical book or something, it's like every sentence is packed with a fact. Yeah. And it's like, oh my gosh, like I got to, I got to pay attention. I was like exhausting. This is awesome. Uh, but then I now I know there's this big reading right now that's like, like one of the best books I've ever read, literally the first 10 pages have more insight than any book I've ever read. And I'm only on page 30 because I'm like, I'm like rationing this not to like, not because I don't, I think I'm a run out.

It's like, I can only, it's like, I can only have my mind blown so many times per minute. And so I got to like chill out with this book right now. And I'm reading 10 pages at a time. Then I hand it to my trainer and he reads 10 pages just so I have a two day break. And then we bring it back. That's our book club right now. And I think it's more like that, like what you, what you just said, which is how many lessons were there to learn? Right. So there's like, there's the lesson of like, you know, guy goes from sleeping on the gym floor to, you know, like hustling, but then realizing I'm hustling a hundred percent or I'm hustling level 10 at a level two opportunity.

Okay. How did he recognize that way? What, and then people got to ask themselves, what level is my opportunity that I'm at right now? And you had that formula of like number of units, old times, of course, profit per unit times, like, you know, supply demand dynamics of the market. That's what I'm saying. That one nugget alone is enough to put down the podcast and go fucking reassess your life. All right. Then we go to the next, next phase. So it's like the part where you're like, yeah, we charge $500 up front. And then we had this continuity thing where we would actually say, Hey, great.

Congrats. You've made awesome progress. We're actually going to offer you more for less because we want our LTV to go longer and we know that that reduces churn, blah, blah, blah. And I'm going to do that because the best time to sell somebody is when they're most excited. Boom. Nugget two, go rethink your sales and pricing strategy. You're probably doing it backwards or you know, you're not maximizing the opportunity because you just sold to them once you never figured out how to sell the back end. Then three is, you know, like you've had five in this session.

And that's my explanation of Sam's, Sam's weird compliment. Sam is the king of backhanded compliments. He'll be like, you're like a, you're like the weirdest looking handsome dude I've ever seen. And you're like, the guy, you know, the guest doesn't know what to do. They get frozen by the other backhanded compliment. It's so good. Well, I bet, I bet your dear friends, when you're with your, your non work buddies, are they just like, dude, Alex, chill. I don't care. Let's just like make a fart joke. I don't have any non entrepreneurial friends, honestly. So you're always able to kind of shoot the shit with them, I guess, a little bit.

And that's how I am mostly with my friends, but everyone's wrong. Like, I'm like, I got, I can't talk money related stuff today. Like I do, I purposely have to take breaks sometimes. One of the things I want to mention that you had said that resonated with me. Conor McGregor has this quote where he goes, some people will look at my success and get bitter most will get bitter and a few will get inspired. And he's like, you know, that says more about you than it does me. And, and similarly, you had something in one of your talks where you were like, you know, if I share, you know, how much money we make or, you know, how we did it, whatever, it's like, some people get envious, some people get angry, some people are skeptical and want to say, is this guy a scammer? Some people get confused.

Like, I don't know what the hell this guy's talking about. And some people get inspired and I'm here to talk to that group at the end. Like that last bit, whoever you are in this room of 100 people, like the four people who are here to get inspired, that's why I'm doing what I'm doing. And I think that's just a great, like question to ask yourself if, because we all get stories all day about Elon Musk and about whatever's going on. And you are going to have some kind of reaction. I have it myself. Sometimes I get envious.

Why should I get envious? You know, like I gave this example. I went to, I went to Vegas and I visited somebody's house who has a eerily similar story to you. They're in the gym business, 60 gyms that were super successful, then transitioned, their bigger opportunity was real estate. They owned the real estate around the gyms and have since made a ton of money. And I felt envious because their house was the most baller house. I think they live near the Panda guy, by the way. He has a house in the neighborhood. That's big as well.

And, you know, unbelievable house is like, you know, you've got to fucking swim in a river to get to the door type of thing. And you're, and I was like, and then my trainer helped reframe it. He goes, he goes, oh man, he heard me saying, I was like, yeah, I'm feeling, you know, a little bit envious. He goes, he just kind of ignored what I said. He goes, man, that's so cool. You get to sample, you know, what you like and dislike. So when you make your money, you're going to know what you want to spend it on.

Is it their cars or is it the pool or is it that he's like, that's so cool. You're getting to sample it and just switching, switching the reaction to, you know, instead of envy that I don't have excitement that, oh, I'm getting to play with all these toys to figure out what I want, what I really like. What, you know, I could think about it or look at images on Google, but like, this way better, I get to drive the car instead. And so, you know, I just think that's a good thing for people. I want to leave people with that is like, study your reactions.

And then also, if you are sharing information, just speak to those who are going to take the positive and don't get so caught up in all the people who are having the other types of reactions to it. That's good. I even without the hair, I still got the guru, Sean. No, that was good. I'm learning. You cut the hair, but you can't cut it away. I got to ask you one last question for being a you, I don't know. You're a business guy who's having a great time on YouTube and you're succeeding a lot. Why is your setup so bad? Like, how do you, you are in a room right now that like doesn't have a carpet, I think, so it's like, I could hear the echo.

You don't have a microphone. You're on your, oh, my God, nice quads. You're sitting on a on a on a laptop, I think, like, shit. That was, sky's out, thighs out, baby. That was a lot of thigh. But your setup, your setup, thank you. Your setup is horrible for such a someone who does this for a living. What the hell? I think I don't do it for a living. You know what I mean? The first answer, honestly, all the technical, I spent like 80 grand on a studio on in my house in Vegas, sorry, in Austin, and I couldn't get the damn thing to work half the time.

So I was just like, and then I ended up like getting just like immediate annoyance around the idea of having to fuck with it again. And so then I realized that I stopped making stuff because I was just annoyed by the idea of having to fix it. And so then I was like, is it better that I just make the stuff and that'll just be, it is what it is. And hey, if I could, if I could figure out a way to not have it be a pain in the ass, then I will do it.

But up to this point, like I'm literally, my video guy got on today. He's like, dude, your video is stopping and freezing for half seconds, like 13 times during this video. And I was like, I don't know. And he was like, can you just do the laptop? When you do the laptop, it doesn't freeze. And I was like, sure, whatever. You know what I mean? And so like, at the end of the day, I think it's like the, in gym launch, when we started, it's probably maybe a good wrap up point, but like, we didn't have a website until we did 20 up until after our second year, we'd already done 40 million in sales before we even had a website.

And then we didn't, I didn't send my first email until we'd crossed like 70 or 80 million collected, you know what I mean? And so like we've, I don't know, we kind of just do things our own way. And if people are down with it, they're down with it. And if they're like, you know what, I'd rather have a really polished guy who says less in more time than like, go, you know what I mean? That's, it's all good. This badass, thanks. Thanks for coming. I've learned a lot. Sean, what do you think? This was fun.

Thanks for coming on, dude. I think people are going to really like this. I'm honored you guys decided to have me on the platform. I know that you guys don't take the time of your attention, of your audience attention lightly. So I want to say thank you for, for thinking that whatever I had was worthy of their ears.
