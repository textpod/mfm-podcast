You see all the best people are crazy. You can't be not crazy and be the best when there's crazy people out there Who want to be the best? Yeah, I'm gonna actually start by asking you a question. I was just talking to a Ben about this would you send your kids to a school and Let them get hit or like not hit but like It's not the right word, but like if you're acting like an asshole They could grab you by the collar and kind of push you against the wall. Are you okay with that? No, you're not okay with that.

I'm not okay with that and it's not because I don't want my kid to get hit It's that I wouldn't trust the person who would be doing the hitting to know The the right way and the wrong way and the right where the line is because I just think about it this way If you're the type of teacher who signs up for that Like if you're the type be sure you go to this specialty discipline school this specialty abuse school To teach like I just don't want that person to have a screw loose and I'm not there to see it So I would rather err on the side of no, you can't hit my kid or like rough them up in any way Unless I'm kind of like I know this person I trust this person I'm there or whatever like like for example I think if it was a coach of some kind and the coach was really tough on my kid I don't know about hitting but like you know kind of punking my kid Totally cool with that as long as the coach is legit But I've seen a whole bunch of people and actually grown up now and look back at some of the teachers and coaches I had to kind of did weird stuff and now that I'm an adult.

I'm like, oh This was just a totally flawed person at the time. I really like I thought they were the authority I thought that they must know things that we don't know and then now I see them on Facebook and they're posting like crazy anti vac stuff and they're like, you know, like preppers and stuff like that. I'm like, oh You know, you kind of always just had a screw loose and at the time I thought I was I was in the wrong for not not, you know Not uh, playing by your rules or whatever I went I went to all boys high school and I was you know I was a jerk at the time and there was times where like the guy the disciplinarian Like you're supposed to have your shirt tucked in and I would if I didn't have it untucked and I got yelled at a bunch of times He would come up and like give you like a horrible wedgie Like they would grab you by the underwear and lift you up and like what if I told you son about this and or like if I like You know, I was disrespectful a couple times and they just would grab me by the shirt and push me against the lager And they're like if I hear from this again, you're over, you know what I mean, and I loved it Was it a military school? It's just a boys school.

No, it was just an all boys Catholic college prep school in st. Louis Surround from that was your high school. Yeah, you went to all boys high school. And what about like before that? I Went in st. Louis the way it works is most people in my area Go to private school and like so I went to a Catholic K to eight and then eight to twelve all boys College prep Catholic school at the time it was like $900 a year Uh, San Ambrose my grade school. So it's like that's just what everyone did. All right.

What do we what do you want to talk about today? Can we talk about your tweet that went viral? That was pretty cool. You boys done it again another hit. How many how many people did it reach? Five million something like that. Wow. So What you wrote Wasn't even that interesting. So I Think it was pretty cool. I would say it was pretty cool. I think the reason I only thought it was pretty cool Was like because I already know you and I know how you think the cooler. There's two cool parts about it This the the the one it was okay.

It was good. It was like a 8.5 out of 10 insight number two The thing that's a 10 out of 10 was the fact that you just thought of it like that that you just it was a pretty original thought I think and like you broke it down That was a 10 out of 10 and one of the other thing that was a 10 out of 10 was that you reached amazing people? So Bill Ackman Bill Ackman if you don't know five or ten billion dollar person Kind of a little bit like a god in the hedge fund world He actually retweeted it and he said incredible Incredibly interesting insight or something like that.

Yes. I thought that was amazing I thought that was so cool And I think that for the listener the takeaway here is like I know you and you're kind of a big deal now But like three years ago you weren't the big deal and now you're basically like one You're like if you dm'd Bill Ackman or loads of other people or you call their email You have access to them and that's pretty amazing about the internet. It's it's true It is amazing how these things go. I'll tell you some cool things that happened. I Don't know why I want to tell you this like I guess I would never really say if I just think of this like a podcast I would never say this on the podcast because it sounds like why you bragging but like If I just think about this like I'm just talking to Sam I'd be like dude, you won't believe what happened.

And so I tweet this thing out it And I guess for people who don't know what it is. I guess I tweeted a thing that was like the It was about the metaverse which is like the dorkiest term ever so you know already I feel lame even talking about my it's lame to talk about a tweet. It's lame to talk about the metaverse I'm multiplying two lambs together But basically what happened is Facebook rebranded or re renamed the company to meta And so it was kind of top of mind for a lot of people and I've been hearing a bunch of people talk about the metaverse Kind of in the investor circle like I remember when we had Who was it that we had on here Mike Maples? I think it was and he was like he was talking about big trends that he had kind of bet on in the past and we said What trends are you betting on now? And he said like you know the shift to remote work This other thing and he goes and the metaverse and like we didn't even really talk about it on the episode But I remember stashing that away as like, huh this pretty legit guy said he's betting on the metaverse and like I Don't even I don't know what a metaverse company is and so I just kind of stashed away as like something I should probably go look into at some point and so I basically wrote a thread that was like Hey, I think the way that people think about this is is wrong so I Thought about it originally I thought about it the way I think most people do which is the metaverse is a place If you've ever read or watched the movie ready player one It's kind of like oh, there's a virtual world like second life or like, you know, whatever this is virtual world We're all gonna go live in hang out video game It's like a video game life basically and that's what people I think it's just with with the with the headset Yeah, like you're plugged in it's something it's some some version of the matrix already player one or people have these different mental models from like books or movies that they've seen and And I said I don't I actually I don't think it's a place I don't think that the metaverse is just like one giant Minecraft world That we're all gonna go live in and hang out in and play in and work in and all that stuff I don't think it's like one company creates this this game and we all go live in it I said instead.

So what if it's not a plot? What if we're wrong about that? What if it's not a place? What if it's a time? I was like, what does that mean? Well a time? I basically described this like parallel so in the AI world for artificial intelligence, there's this idea of the singularity and it's this moment where like Kind of like technological progress just sort of escapes us It just it's it starts accelerating faster than you know, we can imagine and in rough speaking terms This is where the doomsday people think, you know, it's after this that basically the robots, you know the artificial intelligence takes over and humans are done and then other people think it's utopia where Artificial intelligence can just invent things it can create cures for cancer and whatever else and Humans will be saved and like we will all have to just we all just will have hobbies We don't have to work because AI just takes care of everything, but there's this idea of the singularity And it's this moment in time where AI basically surpasses this threshold So I was basically arguing whether my idea was I think the metaverse is actually a time It's a moment in time where We care more about the things in our digital life Than in our physical life and care more doesn't mean like I don't care if my body gets hurt or dies, right? That's not really what I meant but like if you spend all your time working online and Then you communicate with people who are also online and you don't even really know them in real life You're not talking to your neighbor You're talking to this person on Twitter or this person in a discord this person on reddit and then you're watching all of your entertainment is streamed to you online and All of your assets are digital assets like cryptocurrencies and things like that so you know your money is digital like once Everything goes digital more and more things go digital at some point.

There's a tipping point where You basically your identity your assets your social life Yeah, it's all online and I said that to me is the metaverse and it won't be one company It'll be a combination of companies that are all doing that and I kind of gave some examples like you know a Filter in Instagram is basically like a better superior replacement to cosmetic getting plastic surgery or Wearing heavy makeup right like the digital filter matters more is cheaper more accessible to more people because Ultimately you care how you're seen online almost more than you care how you're seen in person, right? Like I know plenty of people that would never they would never post a photo of them with their hair messy and their sweats and their oversized t shirt They would never post that on Instagram, but they'll go to the grocery store like that because who cares? I don't care what these people think, but I really care what those people think so what I was describing was that this is already happening There's this long running shift that's happening where you're caring more about your digital reputation your digital identity your digital assets than your real world stuff and I said so some people this is gonna be like sound like the worst thing ever Some people think this is the best thing ever and not my argument It's not even it's neither the best nor the worst It's just the way the things are going and you'll make of it.

What whatever you choose So anyways, that's what we treat this treat this on like Friday or Thursday And what happened at first nothing really happened It kind of did how I thought it would do initially so initially I was like It's kind of an interesting idea But pretty like nerdy and in the weeds and I don't think it was gonna care and it kind of didn't do much at the beginning And then something happened and it just started picking up steam like it's it's getting more like yesterday I had even more mentions because This you know Fred Wilson is The VC yeah the VC from Union Square Ventures.

He's had this blog like for a long time I think it's like Fred. Yeah, that's great. See you're something like that. He's been blogging for like 15 years I've read his ideas for so long and he made a post his post today was the metaverse He goes I read this really insightful thing and he just embedded my tweet He's like it made me think blah blah blah and so then get the new spike of people or whatever and so yeah So I didn't expect it. I want to know what I was like so okay, so the first thing is after I followed you because of it Let's see.

I started at 178 178 thousand followers and I now have a hundred and ninety three and a half thousand so one ninety three point five We don't do public math, but we can add this up fifteen thousand new followers The post itself has about twenty thousand plus likes, but I'll tell you what was that's that's that's okay That's the that's the cool part. That's numbers, but here's what was fun. I get a call from We'll have to bleep this out, but I get a call right after I post it about 15 minutes later I get a call from a And you know basically I'll bleep that out, but basically a Famous person who has stuff on Netflix and they go dude.

I'm tripping out over here I go I go what and they've never called me before So I didn't remember friends we he had after I so I did that clubhouse thread a while back and this person at DM Be saying hey, that's like that's so on point Well blah blah blah and they said hey if I ever come to San Francisco, you know for for you know You know some my friend my my Hollywood work then Then all I'd love to you know hang out or something and I was like yeah, right and but I gave him my number And so I get a phone call from the person and then they say dude.

I'm tripping out over here You know like he made me a little bit anxious Like this is like what's gonna happen? I think you're right, but I don't know what it means if you're right So anyways, we have this like a little conversation So that was kind of fun and then it starts going into a bunch of NFL players started following and I'm like why would they care and so a bunch of pro athletes followed and And so then I'm you know it slide into their DMs or they're sliding into my DMs I'm just basically it's like clear the calendar all day.

I'm just gonna be answering direct messages cuz really so I don't know who's in here, but I know a lot of values in here so professional athletes Yeah, a bunch of people from the tech industry which you would expect and then anyone intriguing from the tech world Yeah Yeah, I think for I mean Fred Wilson I felt pretty good about like a bunch of the Andre's and guys who had blocked me from the clubhouse thread Some of their partners all the people who blocked me probably didn't didn't didn't reply so they didn't unblock me for this But some of the other partners message and said hey, this is you know, this is great And I said okay, I'm glad I'm not just permanently banned from from from your officers.

That's awesome I think that's great. So this is cool stuff happens and then you know the other thing is that a bunch of people and I realized this later which is I Thought kind of like you know, even if you have one of these Twitter threads that goes viral who cares like ultimately What does it lead to it's fun? But you know who gives a shit but I've seen now months later There was a lot of people who are like like let's say I want to go invest in a company They're like dude, I remembered that thread that was epic and they're just like you're cool Right and you just get the stamp because in a world where it's so noisy.

There's so many people If you do one memorable thing that people respect and like It's like that's the shortcut in their brain that says okay, I like this person. Yeah, I trust this person. Yeah, they're cool It's like just from that. That's not like I wouldn't have ever predicted that so anyways I call these like my little serendipity engines It's like I put it out there in the world and I could never predict what's gonna happen But then all these like kind of second and third order consequences end up happening where you end up meeting somebody going to dinner Doing a deal like it's just all this weird stuff that you can't predict.

So fun day when this happens, but also Such a weird thing dude Like I couldn't imagine even if you told me five years ago ten years ago Like this would be a thing in my life that I would care about I'd be like what are you talking about? Why would I care about that? Yeah, I think it is pretty unique and I think that I met this guy named Blake I don't know what his name is Blake B But I went to Oklahoma City when I was driving through and I had like a MFM meetup or like a Sampar meetup I don't know what it was and I hosted like 20 people for breakfast and this guy came and they're like What would you tell us if you if we want to I forget what that even question was and I go man Get on Twitter.

It's where it's happening and he's on it now And he signed up whenever I did this thing a year ago now. He's got like 50 80,000 followers 50 70. I forget What's his name Blake bird? You probably see him in like the little circle jerk? Yeah, and he was at the meetup. He didn't even have Twitter. I go dude sign up right now and start posting this shit You can meet people. It's pretty amazing You know what's crazy also somebody I'm pretty sure somebody sent it to Zuck because Somebody who's very close to him like respect likes like was like yeah, this is awesome And so I'm pretty sure that person was gonna share it with with him which is kind of crazy, right? Like I literally I watched the keynote of him talking You know, he gave a basically a 30 minute presentation.

I actually want to talk about this So he gave a 30 minute presentation saying we reabranded to meta. Here's why here's what it's gonna be like Not just like here's not just like here's new products. We're gonna build but here's what the world is gonna look like Here's what life is gonna look like. He gave this cool presentation. I don't know. Did you see this presentation a? A little bit it bored the fuck out of me. Oh really? I thought it was amazing. You got bored from that a Little bit. I think like somebody opened the door and it's like hey you want to see what life's gonna look like in 20 years Yeah, I just find it incredibly unlikable Well, yeah, he's kind of robotic but like so I find a little bit harder to watch I Definitely yeah, there's definitely some cringe factor for sure but But the the funny thing is I saw that and I was supposed to have this call with Ben and Ben's like Oh, I gotta like I've you know, I gotta take care of the baby real quick like just you know I'll be online in like 25 minutes.

I was like, okay cool I was like, alright, I got 25 minutes to kill and I just watched this thing and I just tweeted it out And I like to me it was like a throwaway thing. It wasn't like a planned Drafted edited thing and so anyways crazy how that works, but I want to talk about this this meta thing so Not even what? What he predicted or what kind of suck laid out But what do you think about Facebook changing the name of the company in general and like I have kind of a theory on why but but I'd love to hear what you think I Think that if I was Facebook and I wanted to recruit the best people on earth I would do like Is what I've learned running a business and this is something that every business says is they say like an entrepreneur of a 20 person company You even tweeted it about Ben Levy Like I just call Ben like blank, but what should I call him? So this is something that everyone says is true, but it's not which is that titles titles matter people will be like oh titles Don't matter Just call yourself anything.

No, they're actually really important and they matter a ton Even if you're a 10 person company if I was Zuck and I wanted to create a company where people wanted to work Which I think they're struggling to you right now I would change the name of the company and I would have a CEO of Facebook I would have a CEO of this a CEO of that which means there's like a VP There's like a president and that's and then I would give all these people their own kingdoms And that's how I would continue to grow so that's what I would do is I would if I that's exactly what Facebook did or Google So there's a CEO of Google there's a CEO of YouTube a CEO of this of that of that of that and then which each CEO There's like a hierarchy for people to climb and you got to give these people these ladders.

That's why I think it's a great idea That's that's on point. So so basically I've heard I will call it maybe three or four different theories So one theory is what you made this up. Is this real so that's what I know that I In kind of nerd circles, you know, I've just heard a couple people talk about this and I was kind of like Here's what I think it is But let's start with this layout the theory. So three one is it's a recruiting. Why would you do this? Right? They said it's a recruiting thing And it's basically a mix of what you said, which is when you create a parent company now you have like More you created basically another level at the exact level you created a wall You it's like your neck was compressed and now it's stretched out and it's like you just created this breathing room So that person who's otherwise VP can now become CEO and it's like that might be the difference between them Like I know for example the person who who you know was head of or VP of I don't look at the CEO Then look up a Fiji Fiji sumo's title so she was she was in charge of big blue which is the Facebook app and and then and there was Chris Cox before her and they and they ran kind of like multiple products They were kind of like in charge of like the the suite of products But their titles weren't CEO it was something else and she left and now she's the CEO of Instacart So she like left the big ship, you know the the trillion dollar company to go be the CEO of a Maybe 10 or 20 billion dollar company.

I don't know what since cards valued out something like that and And so now you lose that key talent and maybe it's because she looked up and said this guy's never gonna leave This guy was super young. He loves this shit. You know, where where do I go? How do I go up? I can't go up anymore And even the stock price. We're already at a trillion dollars. What am I betting on? We go to 10 trillion like I need some upside and I need some some resume growth here. So that's one theory I like that theory.

I think that's true, but I wouldn't say it's the number one reason Okay, so let's go to the other theories then there's the the skeptical theory, which is dude Facebook's brand is trash it's the Philip Morris of You know, it's a Facebook equals cigarettes and they're just trying to run away from all the bad news and all the bad branding And so they're gonna change the theory So a lot of people think that and there's a there's a there's a subset on that which is if if Mark hires a CEO of Facebook the app Then the person who get called into Senate is that person to go sit in front of Senate and talk all the stuff and they can get sort Of like hammered out there, but Zuck as you know chairman or whatever of of meta It's like, you know, when the Google guys did this date Sundar now or whatever has to go Go in front of Congress and Larry Page can just go and and he's you know Could be CEO of alphabet and not have to worry about that stuff.

So I think that's did you know that? Did you know that one of the Google founders? I don't know. I don't I think it's Larry. Do you know he can't speak? He's got like a voice problem sir Sergei. He's got a little is Larry. It is Larry. Yeah, I think it's Larry So over over the years if you go and wait go to his name type in like his name on YouTube And you'll see a video of him 10 years ago and you could hear it progressing and then like a maybe five years ago You're like, oh, this is really bad.

I'm pretty sure at this point He can't talk at all, but if go this is so interesting Google his name and watch a video of him and you any video That's online. It's probably recent enough that you could start hearing his voice You know, I'm not making fun of him, but he sounds like Kermit the frog like it's a really weird voice for how he looks It's definitely been that way for a few years. I think he can still speak but it's basically it's His vocal cords are like partially paralyzed if I remember correctly. Yeah, it's crazy man It's so if I was him, I wouldn't want to go speak either.

I mean, it seems really embarrassing I mean, he shouldn't be embarrassed, but I understand, you know So by the way that I'm just reading it right now It says 14 years ago He had a cold and then he got like a horse a horse voice from the cold and he just never recovered He went to a doctor and they said his left vocal cord was paralyzed and it's a nerve problem That's causing your left vocal cord not to move properly anymore And yeah, like when I first heard him talk, I was like the video is broken Right because he's super soft spoken, right? So you're like wow It sounds like he's speaking it sounds like the video since Yeah, it almost sounds like the video was in slow motion or something.

It was really, uh, you know, it's sad. It sucks Yeah, it's crazy. And so I think it has happened on his right vocal cord to now Hashimoto's thyroditus. That's well Yeah, it's it's shit. Anyway, but yeah, so if I was him I wouldn't want to speak in front of the Senate either and Ben looked it up Fiji's title was head of the Facebook app So so that's that's one theory which is it's such bad news is a rebrand I think one of the cigarette companies rebranded to like Altria or Altia or something like that So it's like it's a reminiscent of that.

So, okay So that's like another theory and then there's the third theory, which is actually the theory that I subscribe to Which is this is actually just a mission shift And so I remember when I worked at Twitch and this is the second year. I was right before I left So I was kind of like, you know, basically I was on paternity leave. I wasn't even really working at Twitch at that time I was on paternity leave and I was thinking okay. I think it's time for my next thing But I got a phone call from Emmett who's the CEO and Emmett's great and you know I got a ton of respect for him and he basically said hey, I want to I mean he said he'd message me something said like hey, do you have time to talk today? Like I Want to bounce up an off you and he called me and he basically said, you know, there's funny thing has happened Which is that like I think it's eight to ten years ago very early days of Twitch We had we set out like this big North Star mission, which was a million creators getting paid to create on on the platform And so it was like one million.

He's like and at that time we might have had like, you know We were in the thousands or tens of thousands or something like that like a million just seemed a million people getting paid Like earning money doing this. It just seemed like wild and so He's like, you know, so so the million was like super far away He's like and then you know last year like we hit the million and he's like it's just really weird feeling like you you hit this 10 year goal and There's like this amazing part of it, which is holy shit We did it and then there's this numb part of it, which is like wait, it's like now what? What do you do when you hit the thing that you thought was like, you know, it's like when Elon takes a man to Mars Okay, what's the what's the next step, right? It's like if you get to the moon where you got you got to start thinking what do I do now? And so he said, you know, one of the most danger he told me on the phone He goes one of the most dangerous things for a company is achieving your mission Because you have to reinvent your mission.

You have to reinvent yourself and think bigger He's like and so he was like I want to brainstorm with you some ideas on what that could be what could be the mission for the company next 10 years and so we had a good good brainstorm or whatever and And so I think that's what this is I think Facebook is now used by like everybody with a cell phone, you know Facebook or one of the Facebook apps They the mission was connect, you know, like connect the world or whatever. They literally did it They connected the world everybody is using like not only one but multiple So many people use Facebook that when Sarah worked there, I think they were sending satellites to India because they just literally needed more people on the web In order to get ran out of ran out of people with with internet And so like dude, you know, it's that moment where you're your tam your total address will market becomes your actual market share It's insane.

And so to the point where I remember once we were having lunch with Alex the founder of calm And he just started cracking up. I was like what he goes. I just realized he's like dude Think about how many Facebook accounts shut down the churn just due to death. He's like every day There's probably like a million people who just die and stop using the service and he was just like calculate He's like that's insane to me. He's like that if you're at that scale, that's how many people That's pretty well literally just die and stop using our service That's like more people than ever have used our product will die today on Facebook So anyways, I think that this is a mission shift basically I think they achieved the mission one and it's like what's the point of the company now? Is it just to make money and and I think a lot of people think Zuckerberg's pretty evil I actually don't think he's evil.

I do think he likes power As evidenced by like you go read those early like text messages that got leaked of him talking to his buddy at college And he's like dude, he's like, you know, these dumb fucks are just giving me all their information or whatever Like it sounds really evil, but I think he just liked being kind of like the puppet master a little bit But fundamentally, I don't think he's money hungry. I don't think he's driven by money And early on what I remember when Facebook IPO'd he put something in their perspectives that I really liked And I think other people kind of rolled their eyes if you just hate everything Facebook does what I thought it was pretty cool He goes we don't build great services to make money.

We make money to build great services And he's like there's a big important. There's an important difference between the two Yes, we care about money But we care about money so that we have the profits to invest in building great services to hire the best people who can Build the greatest services and the greatest products in the world and I think that's what they're doing now He said they're investing ten billion dollars this year in their virtual reality augmented reality stuff for for like, you know kind of the metaverse which is an absurd amount of money to be investing in this, you know, that's like that's what some people think like, you know This stuff is gonna be worth someday if you if you started a company in VR You'd be hoping it'd be worth ten billion dollars a day.

He's investing that as one years R&D, which is insane I Want to talk to you about a bunch of different things But but I want and I want to ask you about that your real estate guy your real estate buddy But someone said they like when we rambled about normal stuff and I want to get we can make this really quick But did you watch UFC on Saturday? I did. Oh, I watched a part of it. Yeah, I watch Hamsa Okay, so I want it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you're into UFC or not I want you all to do this.

So a few weeks ago a few months ago. We talked about this woman named Rose Nama, Nama Eunice Nama Eunice her name is Thug Rose She's this little white hair lady with like a shaved head really cool And she was muttering to herself like I'm the best I'm the best before the before the fight and it was inspirational It was and then she knocked out this woman and it was like inspirational because she's very endearing She's very cute like there's everything to like about this woman There's this guy who's kind of the same thing but the opposite So there's this guy that is about to be the best, but he's not the best first not the best yet His name is Kamzat.

Okay, and he's this There's for some reason there's a huge Chechian Group of UFC fighters Chechnya if you don't know I don't want to sound like a fool. I'm not incredibly well researched It's like a subsidiary of Russia. It's a region of Russia They're mostly I think so they're they're they're white and they look white, but they're They're devout Muslims and they're Russian I don't know how like if they consider them through Russia or not, but we Americans would say oh, you're just a Russian Muslim That's what they look like and they're known to wrestle a lot of them are from this area called Dagestan Where if you imagine your head what Afghanistan looks like that's kind of what this area looks like and it's in Russia And they basically have gone through just a ton of war lately in the last like 20 years 30 years So there's this guy named Kamzat and he had a cleft lip or something like that so his lip is all crooked and he is so Scary looking and he comes in and he knows how to speak English now But his attitude and what he says he says the same thing who do you want to fight next and he goes? Oh brother? I'll smash everyone.

I'm going to kill everyone. I'm gonna take their soul And he's been saying that this whole time and he's been in four fights in the UFC And he's been punched in the face one time once this weekend is absurd Which is absurd this weekend he fought the best Chinese guy I forget if you're laughing with Lee He's just he's a little bit older But he's considered the best out of China and he picked him up and he walked over to the side of the cage where Dana was and He yells to Dana get off your phone watch this and he gets on top of the guy and chokes him unconscious and So and that in the interview afterwards in the ring and outside the ring he goes brother I'm just here to smash everyone to kill people.

Who do you want to fight next? Everyone brother. I killed everyone I'm here to kill everyone brother. I love this. I'll kill everyone. That's all he was saying And they go what are you gonna? Are you gonna fight the number one person? He goes well They're gonna have to give me the number one person because I'm gonna kill everyone no one will be alive and then he even said something he goes he goes They go, you know, where'd you get this mentality or something? He goes? I'm crazy man He goes I goes I just you go he goes you don't these all the best people are crazy You can't be not crazy and be the best when there's crazy people out there who want to be the best and I just thought that's not true It's absolutely.

He goes. I'm a gangster. He goes. I'm a gangster. I'm crazy And I think there's two there's a few things to learn here. The first is I Think a lot of that is born I think a lot of that is just an act that you've turned on because in his case I imagine he's seen a lot of tragedy and like fucking war and he like created this tough guy persona in order just to survive You know, he's the second thing is I think you could tell yourself that consistently and you kind of can become it And the third thing is this these guys these zakastani guys and also there for some reason this weekend all Russians one Peter Yon one he's Russian all these Russians.

Well, they're crushing it. They've got something in them I don't know what this Russian attitude is that I've noticed them out these guys But it's this it's this very quiet. Although comes out even though he talks a lot of shit. He's still really quiet It's this quiet subtle confidence and I love it when if I watch them their videos over and over again Fedor had it They've got this quiet confidence and I'm in love with that. I'm in love with it. Yeah, they have a tenacity That's pretty crazy the I was watching I was going through I was just browsing on tiktok and this clip came up related that That like in the NBA most of the NBA is not like that like there's a there's not many Russians in the NBA but be Kind of silly UFC is one of the only sports where people go and say I want to kill everybody And any other sport they don't really say that on in the press conference, right? They might say it trash talk on the field when there's no microphone to pick it up But in the UFC they just literally say it to the reporter the reporter writes it down and publishes the post or whatever You know, and it's one of the only sports.

It's one of the only sports. You can't play Right. Yeah, yeah, you can't like play it. You know, it's like if it's like something Too cool little nuggets here So early on the founding story of the UFC is pretty pretty wild but it was started by some somebody else and then Dana White who's currently the president of the UFC Pretty famous guy. He's like a part of the show basically He goes to every single event. He sits cage side He's he's every like and they do like an event in a different place every weekend. And so this guy's he's now a billionaire and he said and he's a very outspoken guy like Imagine the commissioner of your favorite sport, you know, they're usually a pretty buttoned up guy usually ex lawyer You know, they just say, you know, we as the NFL are committed to upholding integrity and blah blah blah And Dana White will post like oh this fight's gonna be awesome And some somebody in an Instagram comment will be like this fight sucks or that's too expensive for the pay per view And then he was my fucking clown.

Yeah, he'll be like you fucking clown like shut up You fucking clown and then that's like he says that it's like what what's CEO of what company is able to just say that to their potential customers It's insane the whole sports savage, but he said something early on because The bet that he made the investment that they made they bought the UFC for about two million dollars and It wasn't his money. He convinced his two kind of childhood friends the fratitas who own casinos. That's their background That's how they made their wealth Convince them. Let's buy the UFC and then they ended up pouring in like 50 or 60 million dollars at a loss To keep it alive to promote the thing and he kept believing kept believing kept believing They kept pouring millions and millions of dollars in and it looked like it was not gonna work And then it has now since turned around as a public company and it's you know, it's all working now They sold it for for you know over four billion dollars.

So I think it and I was and I was looking at it It's a great company. It makes like three or four hundred million a year in profit And they asked him Dana What gave you the faith that this business would work when all the evidence just said the guy who tried who the guy who did this before me failed nobody else has done this in America and And you guys are bleeding like 40 50 60 million dollars. Why did you continue? He goes because I get people and he goes I understand humans. He goes Let's say we're out on a playground.

There's a football game going on over there. There's a soccer game over here There's a basketball court over there people shooting hoops And I said, oh my god that Russian guy's fighting that Chinese guy Guess where everybody's attention goes he goes everybody looks and then everybody runs over to watch the fight He goes, that's how humans are wired. You can't help but turning and looking when a fight breaks out and that was the whole like Thesis that was the underlying psychological nugget. I loved that, you know that that that is how simple He was thinking and he goes he goes and he goes and by the way This is a sport that transcends every country.

Yeah football is huge in America go to the UK. Nobody cares We have fighters who are like the pride of the UK. It's a huge we're huge in in the UK We're huge in Australia. We're huge in Africa We're huge in China like this can get bigger than any one of those sports because we can tap into the global population Cuz fighting one person punching another is a universally known sport. You don't need to even know the rules It's not like basketball or football or baseball like it's like if I try to watch cricket. I don't know what's going on I don't know the rules but with two people are fighting.

I understand the premise I get what's going on and and it's like, you know This is historic barbaric thing. So anyways, I love that business side of the UFC as well So if you're a UFC person that you know, I'm talking about if you're not that was pretty cool and this weekend There's a couple things there's I'll say it really quick that the main thing is this guy Kamara Usman African immigrant comes to America during college kicks ass the American dream. He's fighting against a Devout maga Trump supporter. So that story is very fun The second fight is the Rose down in Eunice who I like she's finding the best one from China She's they're both amazing and then the third one is like these both Midwestern hardworking guys who are just gonna stand there and bash you They're just like bangers.

They just stand there and bash each other's brains. And so that's the cool fight this weekend. All right What do you got? Let's do something else. Let's switch topics here. I have you have a couple things on here. Let's do a quick idea actually so So Ben had this idea that I liked he goes He goes, you know, my brother's a real estate agent and he goes real estate agents are really competitive with each other You know in any given city, they're they're fighting for kind of like the pie is this big You know, it's either my client or yours.

There's not a whole lot of You know, there's not a whole lot of ways for real estate agents to collaborate with each other Some like to do deals together like I found the buy side and you're the sell side great We can I'm confident we can get our clients to hammer out a deal But for the most part, it's a very kind of doggy dog world all agents are like the sports agents Whatever, but he goes with real estate agencies like there's something interesting that that you know might be a niche little business And he goes and so I called it real estate buddy, which is basically When you're close to your real estate agent in Florida or right now, California You're real estate agent California and a bunch people move into Texas that agent in California is not going to help you find the home in Texas But maybe I helped you buy your your California home and you don't know any agents in Texas So what if I had basically a buddy in every state that if my client is moving there I can pass you to them and and basically I get a share of the commission and they get a free referral free trusted client basically that somebody else has put the time and energy into build up trust and so you could create this network of leads basically and and partnerships across borders where there actually is a big incentive to collaborate because Other while it both sides benefit from this whereas normally it's extremely competitive world So I thought that's a little interesting of a niche business.

Maybe something like that exists. I'm not super deep in that world Have you ever um Have you used bigger pockets? Like to learn you mean, you know, yeah, do you know bigger pockets pockets? It's like a real estate kind of like media company and it's a forum plus podcast Yeah, I'm buying real estate. I think that could be potentially a huge business I don't think it is huge, but I bet it could be so if you look at the reason I see them all the time is when we look at our podcast rankings were like on a good week will be like 10 11 12 13 14 15 in the bid business categories on a bad week will be 40 50 and and bigger pockets is like always number three and then they have another one that's like number six and they got another one That's like number 11 Like they're always in the top 10 most listened podcast bigger pockets has three or four of them and then they got this forum that costs Well, it's free, but you could sign up and get extra stuff.

I'm a $300 a year paying member And I think what these guys are doing is they're like built this business and media Arm or whatever and then they just use all their cash flow to go and buy more real estate Um, it's it's an amazing company. I love bigger pockets. I think if you want to build a community This is the company that cut and make money from it This style and you want to do it like with a style where you get a lot of people these guys are one hundred This is the model.

This is the perfect model on how to do it Yeah, that's actually a great point because bigger pockets has existed for a while and it's always been important The main guy I think Joshua Josh Dorkin or something as a name. He sold it at some points I think it's I don't know who owns it now. Let me see if I can find out So basically he sold the thing not for a ton if I remember correctly McCarthy not a good thing to sell He's yeah, and PE and this is such a valuable property. So it was just like a forum.

Yeah, and I don't know the full I mean he could why he could he could raise this is like Angelus. He could raise like a massive fund Yeah, exactly. And so I think he had like a meta There was there was some story like you had like a medical emergency for his kid or something so he had to take time off And he's he ended up selling it. I don't know how how it all went down, but I think you could compete with this I think you could build a better bigger pockets It would be hard.

I'm not saying it's easy But I think that they would be extremely valuable and if you're gonna if you're gonna build a community or a media company and any niche this is one that I would I would bet on because You know if you're not gonna go for something new and sexy like crypto or whatever, you know This is where a lot of money is to be made and there's always a new batch of people that want to learn about making money in real estate How to buy real estate? This is always a new group of people who are looking to like, you know learn connect blah blah blah and And maybe bigger pockets is pretty like established with its crew But you know who's number two if I just said who's number two behind bigger pockets? Certainly there is somebody But I don't think it's as household of a name right now And I wonder if you can take some other angle and do it by the way, can you talk to me? Let me let me let me tell you about something that I let me talk about something real quick something that you've never Maybe you're about to say what I'm gonna say a house something That's not a household name and is huge in our little world.

There's this group. It's a guy or a group of guys called Ganges this is exactly what I'm gonna ask you about Okay, I've got to tell you I'm getting dinner with these guys tonight Okay, so Ganges like no offense Ganges. I think you guys are wonderful. I've met you. It's a really weird name at first So I guess it's not spelled this way. I guess it just means gay angel Okay, so it's this I think it's one person who started it Lorenzo. I think his name is he's gay. I guess based off of Doing some research on him and I think he was a successful entrepreneur.

I'm meeting him tonight So I don't know his whole background, but he started this group called Ganges And I believe it was an email list of gay Give the headline first. Why is this interesting and then didn't give the background? Yeah, you're right So it's this group of people or it's this guy who's got this it's not a fun but it's like a investment group and this year alone the rumors that they're gonna invest around four to five hundred million dollars and Previously they've invested collectively over the past few years like 300 million dollars So like next year or two years their total investment is gonna be like a billion dollars Which is basically like a three billion dollar fun kind of like that you invest if you have a three billion dollar fun I would imagine you invest that over five years.

So like that's like the numbers we're talking here And basically the way it works like a very large This is startup investing. So this is like a very large technology fund that I have never heard of the bigger And it seems like a niche fringe thing. It's like, oh, that's cool like a LGBTQ fund What do you have like a two million dollar fund and you're investing in you know some cool companies It's like no, how are they deploying? How are they getting four hundred million dollars in a year to deploy? And then how are they? This I don't think they get any money if you Google it's it's spelled Ganges like gain like GAIN and then JOLS Ganges And if you look at their portfolio and if you just Google Ganges and click news You'll see all these tech crunch articles that it says, you know And this company raises money from a dream and this this this and Ganges this this this and Ganges will say for every article And if you go to their port, then you see their portfolio page.

It's legit. Yeah, dude They're in everything Ganges is in everything. They're in everything and what they do is they find companies and they write a page about it and then they send it out to an email list and people invest and they get a 20% carry in it and they Take also a fee of like eight or ten thousand dollars per deal that they take out of that money And they use that to as their like finders fee so they could pay their lawyers and things like that And that's the whole business model and they've got like this web of like five or six or seven people who will Also send the deals that Ganges gets access to to their audience and those people who send it to their audience also get a stake in the Of the carry and that's it's a very simple business model are most of the investors gay or that's just the most of the people who started They're gay.

What's the stick? Can I do it if I'm not here? So here's a Yeah, so here's the thing why it's kind of crazy is it must have started like they oh like mostly invested into gay and lesbian and transsexual or you know, whatever lgbt, you know, whatever the Sorry, I'm not me lb l. I'm just struggling lgbtq Yes, is that it? That's the new Intro music. I think maybe you just stumbling over lgbtq is Oh, I'm just whatever it lgbt I just can't say it properly That so it started with that that was their thing But then like they invested like they've invested yeah, they invested in home Which is the company you and I invested for testosterone.

Yeah, and that's like a pretty masculine male I guess you could say like well, maybe if you're transitioning you would want to take testosterone, but um They invest in like lift. So like I don't know where like how the the LGD whatever Just like just skip it LG lgbtq Q thing lines up with the with the whole with like other other companies But that was definitely their angle and it's not anymore But it's a great angle because you know, there's not a lot of gay and lesbian investors and then they're like, hey look That's our whole shtick like let us in I understand it totally works Do you remember Do you remember when you stopped using gay as a as a term for like You know just be meaning like whatever like something is lame or something is stupid.

Oh, yeah in high school And do you remember what got you to stop when you realize like oh wait, that's not cool Just like when I had like gay friends. I was like, oh, that's not very nice is it and and then like I talked to my Nephews and they're like in the my Sarah's and their Sarah's nephews and they're like 14 15 and 13 And I was just curious and I was like, hey, do you guys ever insult someone or does anyone ever insult someone for being gay? And they're like, what do you mean? I'm like, you know, like do you ever say like don yeah? Yeah, like, you know, you say like hey man, that's really gay.

You're gay and they go But like why is it bad to be gay? And I was like, it's not you just answered you just answered my question Thank you and they just it just not part. You know what I mean when you're kids when we were younger That's and it was crazy. Yeah, it's I don't think young people like and that's insult people for being gay I think it's pretty crazy. Yeah, I think that means like in 20 years because probably when I was 10 That's like what everybody in my school was. Oh, you know, that was like a common thing to say It's I think that means in 20 years it went from Just common and people did it without even thinking to like it would now be kind of disgusting It would be straight.

It's like it's not even like it's not even an argument. It's like wait, why would we do that? That's like I would I refer to you know, like why would I why would I try to use that as an insult? That doesn't make any sense. I like in my head There's like the n word and then there's like the f word like you know what I mean like I wouldn't ever you know I mean if I heard someone say that I would be like flabbergast I'd be like what yeah, it'd be like when I was a kid It was like the word like, you know, if you said the word if there's like this that was like the C word now like I wouldn't say I mean you meet some British people or Australian people they say Yes, but like it's yeah, it's kind of crazy how that how it's changed.

I mean obviously it's good, but yeah I remember as a kid. I'm we got a shout out time and then The person who first told me like hey, by the way, you know, that's not cool, right? I was It was this guy who actually just just I think yesterday or two days ago or something the news came out that he's engaged gay And he's engaged to to this guy. He's been dating for 11 years. So the actor Cal Penn he When I was a kid I was in a movie and he was my older brother in the movie and so we like would hang out on the set all the time and I remember saying it when whatever I was just calling so I was trying to say something was stupid or lame or whatever weird I don't know what I was trying to say.

I was this little kid It's probably like in sixth grade or something and he was just like He was the first person that I never even brought my attention to he goes You know, that's not like you shouldn't say that when you just mean some things like weird or not cool Like you shouldn't say gay and you should say something else and he wasn't out that time I don't know if he even knew at the time But he brought that to my attention and I felt so I remember feeling so dumb because I looked up to this guy I thought he was so cool and I was so nervous about it set with yeah, he was totally nice He kind of like big brother to you.

Yeah, he big brother me was just like you know like by the way Like, you know, you shouldn't do that like think about it blah blah blah and I was like, oh that makes total sense Like I never even thought about this like and in that time and that even in my my world where I lived Houston, Texas It's not like I even like I went back. It's not like I was the last one to know Nobody even really thought about it But he was like in Hollywood and I think it was like, you know people on the West Coast were People on the coast tend to be like a little more like kind of forward and liberal and progressive with that type of stuff So so I remember hearing that and being like, oh man, I just made a fool of myself and like yeah, that's silly I don't know why I do that and I just stopped after that.

And so it came full circle Yesterday, but anyways, we can do another another topic. What else you got? All right, let's do it one more All right, I'm gonna tell you about Actually, do you have one you want to do you want me to go? Let's do this one. That's about Companies, so I had this idea. I I don't even know what it is, but I was reading that tech Tesla was doing something called gigaFest Do you know what gigaFest is? Yes, so basically if I remember correctly they a lot of people like liberal media got angry because they're like Tesla's throwing a festival during a pandemic But basically they rented out a town in Germany and they're doing like a conference or festival And like what's happening at is it like drinking in music or is it like car? Technical stuff, do you know? I Have no idea so okay.

Honestly, it doesn't even matter what it was. I just saw the name I thought oh man Tesla's doing another smart thing like they basically took October Fest and they just rebranded it for their thing and it's good I assumed it's gonna be some combination of like fun as well Like you know between music and food and drinks and all that as well as like, you know things that are relevant to you know Building cool cars and then recruiting talent and just building the brand and having people have a great experience at the brand I started thinking Why don't more companies do this and I first I thought well certainly They're not the only ones and I started thinking about other examples of this So there's like the Macy's Day Parade which I don't even know like what how that got invented I don't know the backstory, but since I was a kid I remember that there's always the Macy's Day Parade on TV And it's like why did Macy's get in on that or we've talked about Michelin star restaurants right Michelin tires You know the tire company basically inventing a food restaurant ranking system so that you would have a reason to go drive You know far out places to go try these amazing restaurants They created demand for for driving long distances through the Michelin star and they just got their name and in all that and You know there's the Forbes 30 under 30 list and then there's like in San Francisco every year if you live in San Francisco You know dream force.

It's this like Full like kind of it shuts down half the city and there's sort of like a parade and there's like big bands like you too come and perform But it's like for the most boring thing. It's like a sales CRM Dude, do you want to know why people most people more people don't do this? Yeah, I think a lot of people actually try and it just doesn't work. All right, so the fortune 500 Fortune 500 is that basically just means the top 500 companies in the world at this point Do you even think fortune 500 means fortune magazine? No, right.

Sometimes it does over overtake the brand like Michelin Michelin star means more to me than Michelin tires Do you when you think have you ever? Shopped at a Macy's Of course, I've shopped at a macy's before yeah, have you been at a macy's in 20 years? Not 10. Yeah, 10 years probably cut off. So a lot of so there's one I think a lot of times people do this I always work with like creative people and maybe I'm just sometimes a pessimist around this stuff a lot of times They get give me these ideas and I'm like this is just fucking stupid and I don't think this is gonna increase sales I'm just trying to survive at the moment and and And it's like I agree.

It's not for when you're in survival mode Which is where I spent most of my career in startups is like You're you're not in survival mode or you're in survival mode If you don't turn if you don't make this work, it's gonna just die So you don't have time to plan a parade with a music festival and like all the stuff that wouldn't make any sense And here's the other reason why this isn't a good idea though This isn't a good idea a lot of times because most companies they're just fucking lame like imagine like I'm trying to think like just like this window blind company Hunter Douglas Like they're gonna have like what a blind fest like I don't know.

I mean, I guess I think there's some cool shit Like, you know blend tech The blender have you heard a blend tech the blender and they had will it blend that was awesome I loved will it blend. Do you remember that YouTube state channel? Yeah, yeah, of course I love will it blend but a lot of stuff is just lame and I don't want to celebrate it now a few boring things that I think could work is What's that vacuum company everyone loves Dyson Dyson. Yeah, dude, I'm about to I'm like been staying up at night I wonder if I'm gonna buy one of these $700 vacuums.

Have you ever used one of them the handheld one? Yeah, it's like a wall amazing one. Yeah, I have it's amazing Everyone you have one you pay 700 bucks for it feels so satisfied dude I feel like I get 700 bucks of value every time I use it So like Dyson has like is like boring and and I dig I would do that I can't I'll have to think of like what else is like boring and awesome But dude any any company could do this all you have to do is attach your boring name to awesomeness And it does work it does work to an extent now It's not going to turn a bad company into a good company But it does take a boring company and make them slightly less boring it makes them more relevant And in general I just feel like those same dollars just go further.

So like I see so many dumb billboards or Just like useless events or useless like ads Um, you know on the all over the internet and I just sort of think man, you know for like $200,000 you can throw like a whole music festival You can do like some amazing things with $200,000 and that's what they'll spend. Yeah, but I don't want to go to like Floorock or Clorox bleach and imagine dragons like I just don't give a shit You you might Did you want to go to a tire restaurants reviewed a tire tire companies restaurant review reviews? No, you didn't maybe but like when I think of like Like Clorox and like the killers like I don't think like I'm gonna buy more bleach Dude, mr.

Brightside although maybe maybe I don't know that's a good point walk right into that one. I don't know. I'm not sure if it could work maybe But I think and I also think a lot of those things I don't think they're as successful often Like whenever I was thinking of like fortune 500 or michelin. I'm like I don't fucking that don't associate that with the magazine the magazine's still gonna go bankrupt anytime Um, so anyway, I don't know like I think the Victoria secret fashion show is a good example also of like Going overboard on these kind of events and like just put your you're not directly trying to sell your thing You're creating a spectacle.

You're attracting the type of people you want like for example We have an ad budget for this podcast where they're like dude. Hub spot. It was great. They're generous They're like you guys are in our our hub hub spot podcast network. We want to help you grow So they gave us a little bit a little bit of cash a lot of money and I can't think of a thing to do with it Exactly because and what what's the plan right now? The plan is to go spend a shit ton of it on Spotify ads Right and that might work and and other podcasts and other podcast platforms and that might work.

I don't know. We'll see I might guess it's gonna work very poorly. So I'm saying with that same amount of money. Can I say how much money or no? Uh, hundreds of thousands of dollars a quarter. So hundreds of thousands of dollars maybe maybe we could say like, uh, In the range of a million dollars a year Right, so I don't know like let's take our audience our audience is kind of this hustler type mindset Our audience is this person who likes to they like investing. They like building shit. They want to make money They they like hearing about billion dollars companies and billionaires and things like that Like what could we do that would just get I don't know like if we got 50 000 people to pay attention to something I think that would be a huge win, right? So what would be a Either an event or a stunt or something that's of service to people the equivalent of what red bull did right like red bull was like Dude, we're we're an energy drink.

We're all about sort of like, you know, this is kind of badass lifestyle All right, we're gonna put a guy in a wingsuit. We're gonna take a guy like what? Do though I've lost thinking about this. I don't know like I just need one Um, okay. Let me think of one. I think that we could do um What do people who are startups? What do people who are into building businesses? What are they? What are they super into that that's dude? It's I've gone through this mental exercise and I'm it's Okay, I have a dumb simple one for me.

I have a dumb simple one. I remember these people set up a A headshots, uh, by the way, your computer screens like covering your face or something. Oh, there you go. Um, I remember this, uh Uh, like a fitness company did this they they parked their van outside of the uh sales force tower And everybody who's coming in they're like, do you want to get your body scanned real quick or do like this bmi test to do this test? I'll tell you I love it They just hired hired two people to stand outside the fucking like tower and they just got a bunch of people in and they like While they were there they got said, what is this all about? Who's doing this? Why do I get this free thing? And uh, they got to learn about their learn about their body while then being so upsold into like signing up for these scans and personal training and a gym membership after that And um, I saw somebody else do this with headshots.

They're like, you know what like your picture online just like looks like shit Sean, but we can do we get only to do What's that? So what do you want to do for us? Yeah, so I'm saying we could come up with something where let's say we had I don't know if you've ever seen those like three 360 degree cameras Uh, you can rent these things for like a thousand dollars We could have a pop up in a city in in in new york And all you got to do is if you show that you're subscribed to the pod you can get a free epic headshot done for you And we just pop them up, you know near downtown or a bunch of people live and that thing would cost us You know, I don't know three grand total for the day But might have like a thousand people have like a unique experience or two thousand people have a unique experience Or maybe we can have like a blimp going over Yeah, going over miami and the blimp is gonna, you know airdrop, you know Some like cash or the blimp is going to display some qr code or something like that and there's a giveaway inside I don't know like some kind of big million dollar bills Yeah, some kind of stunt or whatever like let's say Um, something that's like on I hear you.

I'm on board I've just been going through this and I'm like what is worth pulling off like these are bad ideas I gotta admit the ideas I had just now are bad ideas, but I feel like if I brainstorm for an hour Which I'm gonna do I feel like we come up with a great idea and it's a better use than that the ads I'll do the same I think I think it requires both to be honest and I'll do the same I think and this is like a good example of whenever I talk to people and they're like well I'll start this company once I get funding.

I'm like if you had the money, you wouldn't even know what to do Trust me the money's not the issue right and that's how I feel right now. I'm like the marketing budget is not the issue Yeah, I'm like we got the money. We got the people. I just don't know like this Which is kind of fucked up. Rameet Rameet talks to people about this all the time He's like once you're rich, what are you gonna do and people actually struggle with this all the time? Right. I struggle with it. I had this uh phrase I used to say at our startup, which is you can always run out of money, but you can never declare creative bankruptcy and that was that was always my rule was like I cannot have a conversation with somebody who says I can't think of an idea I don't know what else we could do.

It's like you've declared creative bankruptcy And like now you must go out that door and never return again And and I was just my rule So even if I don't have an idea I don't declare bankruptcy Those guys at outside magazine asked us if we wanted to do the adventure I don't think you replied yet by the way. Not yet. I sent you. Do you see it? Okay, and they're like well, what else they're like, what else do you want to do and I'm like Oh, I have no idea I feel like such a punk.

I can't think when like they're like, well, we can go anywhere as long as we're there and back in three days I can't think of a thing It's fucked up Like I don't know. Okay. Who does our audience look up to warn buffet? Like he auctions off his like lunch thing every year for like a hundred grand or whatever It's like dude, that's it. There's no way it's only a hundred grand. I think it is Might even be less but like I know uh, like Andrew Wilkinson did his I think it was like It was like, I don't know too grand or something to get lunch with him You know how many people would want to do that? Like we could just host these we could get people to like Come and be able to hang out have a have a lunch with chumath or something like that We could do a giveaway that is we spend the money here But then we dangle that in front of people In order to get them interested and excited about what we're doing now Those are kind of disconnected to what we're doing, but I refuse to declare creative bankruptcy is my answer We just got to think about it.

I because this it's been bothering me as well where I'm like What what should we do because if you're listening to this imagine this We have hundreds of thousands of dollars of budget and we we want a whole bunch more people to subscribe to the podcast And just get down with the mission like realize that there's a cool podcast out there that they might like The reason you like it there's a whole bunch of other people that would like it for that same exact reason They just don't listen to it yet. They never heard it.

They don't know that they should try it And so how would you turn hundreds of thousands of dollars into hundreds of thousands of subscribers is the question and And so, you know, if you have ideas, obviously my ideas kind of suck say I'm refusing to have an idea right now So we need we need ideas Sure, uh, ben. What do you think we should do? This is like the teacher calls on you and the worst no no no this is good because I was actually talking about this this morning with Darren and Jonathan, but um It's hard right.

Well, so here's one idea that we had was we had this TikTok go not viral, but it did well on tiktok. Do you see that? Sean, what was it? It was a Rob Deirde thing Um, what's his name Jacob like texted me on Saturday night and he was like, hey, I made this and posted on tiktok got like 100,000 views Yeah, which is like good. So what we were saying is what if we just put up 10 or 20 thousand dollars and just said Hey, we're gonna put out the video files from my first million anyone can access the raw video files And uh, if you want to make content for us great and at the end of the month We'll give 10 or 20 thousand dollars to whoever gets the most views on tiktok or instagram reels Like a 99 designs contest.

That's not a bad idea That's actually a really good idea 20 grand to it in in order to be submitted to the contest you have to um You have to post it on twitter or instagram. Yeah And uh, that's a great idea actually so a consistent 20 grand a month contest for the best clip Yeah You can produce it you can just put it out there because you have a big audience, but like whatever. Yeah Do whatever you want That's actually brilliant, right? I don't I'd seen I think that's the greatest idea yet Right, right.

He almost went greatest idea ever. He threw yet in there just to save himself. I was so close Yeah, let's do that. All right. I'm gonna publicly brainstorm the ideas on twitter. That's how that's how we're gonna do this No, I'm gonna add that one to it though I'm gonna create a thread I'm gonna add these ideas to it and then I'm just gonna continue until we have a winning idea It's just it's a rolling twenty thousand dollars and every single month one person gets twenty thousand dollars And the criteria is the people who are posting the best most interesting most viewed Mfm video content my other idea is I guess I'm just into contests But it's like hey if you want to join this contest show up to downtown um Preferably somewhere we're not a lot of people are from so like st.

Louis cleveland Austin whatever and uh, Austin actually Austin's a bad idea, but um, okay We're gonna give you a category so it might be food. It might be exercise and fitness, but You have 24 hours and whoever can make the most money wins this contest and we'll give you an extra twenty thousand dollars It's essentially an entrepreneurship contest I got a better idea Fuck your idea. Here's a better idea All right, here's a great idea. Okay, so uh sam How much does it cost to um to sponsor like an open bar at a bar? Like set up a bar tail.

Let's actually let's say Let's do this There's we pick ten cities around the country And we say hey in these ten cities if you're one of us There is a place where you can go and you can hang out with other people who are like that like like us at the ball Like you know like you have heard You could we can say hey, we're gonna do a lot of drinks for three grand Yeah, exactly. We're gonna put up $1,500 and we're gonna do this in ten cities And we're gonna do this every friday for the next, uh, you know, let's call it three months or whatever It's like, you know the winter the winter fest and we say great.

We're gonna do that So we're gonna do that 12 times that's 180 grand but basically you've created a And all you have to do to get to redeem your free drink to redeem a drink as you just got to show your subscriber the pod show bar Tender boom you get it. We just call the we get we have cool bars. So like whatever's like your favorite bar in austin Your favorite bar in new york your favorite bar in san francisco, whatever And we just make that our little watering hole and people who are into our shit can go and hang out there And it's not that it's like the biggest mass idea But the spark that would come from a bunch of people a bunch of our fans getting to know each other Hanging out having drinks bringing their friends.

I think a lot of good would come of that a lot of good will would come I don't think that's bad. I don't I think that's worth doing. I would say that the video bounty is to me the most interesting I think that's like wildly interesting. Yeah bars. That's not bad Yeah, I've done that for years and years on all types of stuff. It worked really well for product time. It worked well for us Yeah, it works. What have you done in that? Um, well like for the hustle we've done meetups forever and then when I started my roommate business We had meetups every single week for like two years And so it was basically anyone who's ever looking for a roommate you come That day and we'll have a party with like 150 people who are also looking for housing And in order to come you got to download our app And um another one that does this by the way, it's like it's like physically hard I remember being like I was like exhausted all the time.

Yeah for sure I remember this agency reached out and they had emailed us before being like, hey, we're creative ad agency It's like uh, yep into the into the trash pile like I don't I don't know you I don't this is just some outbound sales and whatever. I don't care and one reached out and they go they they sent They sent a package with invites like they sent us like a physical mail to our office It was a bunch of flyers inside cheap flyers, you know, just flyers whatever they said, hey These are these are ticket entries.

So this gets you entry into this party tonight Um, as well as a free drink. Um, we rented out butter this bar in san francisco. That's like pretty famous and um And they go we're having a meme battle tonight. It's like a rap battle but for memes and we're like what and basically Um, they got like they and then they would email the office manager and they say hey Did you get our package? We sent over a bunch of invites make sure that people know That's for you guys you guys can come and get you know free drink and it's great You know send five or six people to have a great time and happy out of the day And so they saw it it was the email on a flyer and they sent that and then I went there and it's basically like they'd rented out the bar It was a Tuesday night.

So like bar was like, yeah, sure. You know, it's all yours. Go ahead um, and they basically had a projector on the screen and they had a guy dressed up as a cat and a person dressed up as a dog and And they would go it was the the battle was it was a five round battle And basically one would show a funny video clip like a tiktok length thing And then the other person would show it and then the crowd had like that's awesome Little handles where they could vote for the dog or the cat like who's was who's was funnier And it would go five rounds and then the winner would win at the end and that was it was just silly And then the whole shtick was the guy would come on at the end.

He'd be like hey By the way that one the third one that was actually a viral video we made we're rubber republic. We make amazing viral videos Um eight out of ten videos we do get over a million views like we're good at this shit We've done it for these companies Uh, enjoy yourselves tonight And if any of you guys ever want to have a video go viral come find me or the guy dressed up as the cat And I was like and we worked with them. We did a video with them It got over a million views and it was all the one where you talking about John dicks all over biba.

Yeah, exactly That was bright So they made that video for us and so we um and so they were so good and I was like, oh this little sales funnel They did it was actually genius Um, that's pretty good, you know because one client to them is worth tens of thousands of dollars So, you know renting out this bar and inviting people from these 20 companies and just hoping one of them Ends up with you as a as a client is a great way to go All right, well, let's do it ben. Let's let's could we please make one of them happen? All right, let's roll Yeah, you tell me money bags, but yeah, they'll work on you're fired Uh, yeah down, let's do it
