Model: Whisper-small

All right, let's do some topics. What do you got? I got I got a couple. What do you got? A bunch of good stuff. Let's pick one of yours. Let's do the Satoshi and the Paul LaRue thing because they're both really interesting. Do you know let's do let's do which one do you want to do first? I don't know who Paul LaRue is. You don't know who Paul LaRue is. Okay. Great name though. Dude, listen to this. How much more would I be worth if I was Sean LaRue? A lot more. And how much more respect would I get? He's also African.

He's from South Africa, I think. So, Ben, you're nodding a little bit like you know who this is. Is that true? Yeah, I know Paul LaRue is. He's kind of like who's the guy we were talking about that you knew. Ross LaRue. He's kind of like if if Ross had been as crazy as everyone thought but actually like 10 times crazier that's Paul LaRue. Paul. Whoa. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. So, let me. Alright, so he's based. Alright, so Paul LaRue. He's this big old fat disgusting guy. He's like like. Imagine. Like jumping a hood.

Yeah. Imagine like have you seen South Park where they're like playing video games and there's that fat guy on the computer who's like eating Cheetos and like he kind of looks like that. He's just a total slob but he's this computer whiz. Yeah, Google him. He's like disgusting and that kind of fits the personality of the whole story and there's this great book that I'm reading. It's called Mastermind. It's about him and basically this guy always like kind of wanted to take over the world and in around like 2002, 2003, 2004 he started this company called RxLimited which basically sold Viagra and a couple other like schedule two drugs.

So like no like he was able to sell some opioids but not like the famous ones things that are considered scheduled to which is just one below between schedule one and he created this company called RxLimited and in like three or four years it netted him hundreds of millions of dollars in profit and do you remember years ago when you would get an email and it said like, hey, we sell prescriptions. Click here. Do you remember that like years and years ago when you're in high school and grade school? Not really, but go on. Let me say yes.

Go ahead. Well, basically and then like maybe you remember like going to like these websites where like just showed tons of drugs and like you'd get texts that says like buy drugs online. Well, basically he created this website RxLimited and then eventually he started like creating so many domain names that he created his own domain registration system and then eventually his network got so big he created his own email system because he didn't want anyone to hack into his stuff and at one point he had like two or three thousand employees working at this place, mostly Filipinos, mostly working call centers and he had in Philippines and in Israel because he said the Israeli guys were the hardest working for the cheapest, you know, the cheap, the for the cheap rate and he it was it was wild and he had basically hundreds of different stores selling drugs and the way it worked is he would somehow convince a doctor that he was like doing everything by the book and technically he kind of was doing everything by the book, but it really quickly warped into not but basically he had all these doctors in America and like Minnesota, Kentucky, Florida, like these relatively small doctors and like, hey, we're a telemedicine service.

Can you fill some of the prescriptions that we're doing? It's all legal and we'll just send you the prescriptions that we need and you just sign off and we're going to send it to a pharmacy. So he would send it to a pharmacy and these local mom and pop pharmacies would be like, oh, okay, Dr. X is just called in this prescription. I'm going to ship it to the patient. No big deal. And so both the doctors and the patient, doctors and the pharmacists, they all thought that they were mostly following the law. They're like, this is kind of weird that I'm now shipping out.

I'm like a mom and pop pharmacist and I'm shipping out like 2000 orders a week. Like that's weird, but I have no reason to believe this is illegal. And eventually it did become highly illegal where like he, it was just like, you didn't need to see any doctor to get any prescriptions. And at one point he was selling like 80% of all online drugs in America. It was something large. Ben, am I missing anything? And throughout doing this, this is where things get even crazier. So like this story in itself is already interesting. Literally, it made, I believe $400 million in profit in four years.

One employee went to his apartment in Manila in the Philippines and he said that he saw $100 million in cash in the house. And this guy like didn't want the IRS to see anything. So he would just transfer it into gold because this is before Bitcoin was really around. He lived in the Philippines. He was an African guy. So I believe he was born in like Cambodia and then moved to South Africa and then moved to the Philippines. Or maybe he was like Zimbabwe, something like that. But this guy had this like grandiose thinking where he thought that he like, he's like, I owe it to the world to run the world.

Very grandiose thinking. And so he hires these ex Israeli guys to run the call centers. Eventually he hires these ex Israeli army guys to be his bodyguards. And in doing that, he starts learning a little bit about like arms dealing. And so eventually he buys thousands of acres of land in Zimbabwe and Somalia. And he was like, I'm going to raid an African nation and I'm going to set up like a country and I'm going to have my own. I'm going to be the leader of a small African nation and hopefully eventually a much larger nation, like some crazy shit.

And it expands to the point where he's now an arms dealer. So he's selling guns to different parts of Africa. He gets in trouble for selling missiles to Iran. Like this guy gets into some crazy stuff. He's killing people along the way. He makes relationships with Columbia drug lords and trades drugs, pills for cocaine. And he starts selling a hundred millions of dollars with a cocaine. And he was doing all of it almost, almost all of it behind a computer. And eventually he gets caught. Now he's got he recently in like three or four years ago was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

And that doesn't include what he's convicted for in the Philippines. So after he gets out, if he gets out, he's going to go straight to the Philippines. In the U.S. or he's in the U.S. But because he's like basically a drug lord, they won't say where he is. And so you could own online. You can barely find any pictures of him other than one picture of his mugshot. And that's the only pictures that you could, the one where he looks like really big. That's his mugshot. That's the only picture that I really seen of him recently.

And the guy, it's just, this is one of the craziest books I've ever read. And what I, I start talking to you about Satoshi because a lot of people think they're like, well, we don't, I don't, I don't really, there's not a ton of evidence to shows that he invented Bitcoin. But he was talking about like creating a digital currency early on when he was arrested. Satoshi quit blogging and you could read a lot of this guy's emails. And that's really interesting. And that's kind of how I got to the other topic of Satoshi where you can like read all of his old blog posts.

But this guy, it's incredibly fascinating. He would have been an awesome business person had it not been for, you know, going the wrong route, but it's a crazy book. What was in the emails? You just see him commenting with people. So he was actually like a really good writer for a little while. And he even, this guy is so interesting. He wrote guest posts, I believe for the Washington Post under a suit of them talking about like the future of money and like all these weird economic stuff. But he, he was somewhat eloquent and, but in person, he was a brutish.

He was an asshole. He was disgusting. He would just, they would go to McDonald's and he wouldn't even talk to his employees. He would kind of tell them to f off. He wasn't very pleasant to be around. And, but in the emails, he wrote pretty, pretty nicely actually. What are you going to say, Ben? They found 500 pounds of cocaine on his yacht when it crashed, which was worth like a hundred million dollars. And he also owned a logging business in Somalia. At one point he was like, I'm going to create a business that will fend off.

So basically all the Western countries driving through Somalia, if they want the pirates not to talk to them, I'm going to be the go between and I'm going to get money from them and I'm going to pay the pirates off and take a little bit of profit. He owned, he owned that business. He also was in the mining. This guy did like at one point, the DA, the district attorney of, I believe New York said, we think this is the most dangerous and powerful man in the world. And all of it was done on the computer.

And he, he, his, his, he was very early in all this. Like he's very kind of in the same ballpark as a lot of the crypto guys. And like some of his ideas, even though he was a criminal, were like totally on point with the Bitcoin stuff. So it's super fascinating. Yeah. There's an article that says how the case for why he might be Satoshi. I haven't read it yet, but when you're talking, I just pulled it up. You say he did it all behind the computer, but, and my research on this is old. I was looking at this story like a year ago, but didn't, don't I remember a story about him like throwing someone off his yacht and having people shoot them in the water or something like that? Yeah.

But in that particular story, he wasn't there, but he did kill a lot of people think that he did kill one. So throughout the Sean, he had his hit men. He had hit men that are now arrested and they like kind of are spilling the beans. He had hit men that would kill people. And there are a few occasions where they think he actually is the one who fired the bullet. So he, and he did travel. So he would go to Africa. He would go here, but the guy had like 3000 employees and most of the employees had no idea who he was.

And even there'd be times where he'd be managing. So basically he had two Israeli brothers running this call center in Israel with like 300 employees and they had never met Paul and Paul would talk to them via email, you know, as employees. And it's kind of like interesting because like anonymous work is something we've talked about, but that's pretty much how it was. So some of his employees had no idea who he was. So in a sense, it wasn't all behind a computer, but a lot of it was behind a computer. This article I pulled up about him, it says, he's the Jeff Bezos of organized crime.

And it says he's the he's the digital El Chapo because he was moving so much weight. He was, he was given up for adoption by his birth parents that rejection haunted him. And then it says he was, you know, transformed himself into a programming genius who developed encryption software like E4M in the nineties. He founded RX Limited, which was the black market for pharmaceuticals. He was raking in $250 million a year selling drugs, weapons and murder for hire on the dark web. Yeah. Well, I think that actually the dark web thing is actually confusing because a lot of the stuff that he was doing was before Tor was even around.

So a lot of stuff he would do, it wasn't even on the dark web. And like this whole thing about spamming email, he was actually one of the originators of that. And so he somehow hacked into a farm, a pharmaceutical company and stole something like hundreds of millions of email addresses. And he would spam these guys like crazy. And the reason why he bought all these domain names is a domain would get banned, then you would switch a domain. So it was incredibly complex what he did. And he, before he turned to the dark side, he founded a, or he built like a small open source product that helped encrypt things.

And eventually turned into this thing called true crypt, which I actually think that thing is big. But so like the guy was pretty genius. He was amazing. It says his first murder was, he took his head of security. He said, Hey, come to my house in the Philippines and dig a hole. I'm going to bury a safe filled with millions of dollars. And then the guy dug the hole and then he shot him with the machine gun right after that. That was the first, his first taste of murder. And then there's another, there's another story where they took a guy out into the ocean and they go, well, let's just have a talk on our yacht.

And they throw the guy in the ocean and they drive away. So he gets, he freaks out and then he comes back and he shoots all next to the guy. And he goes, Oh no, no, no, just so you know, I didn't miss. I'm just trying to keep the sharks away because I want to talk to you. And I need to know, are you stealing from me? And if you tell me quickly, I'll kill you now. If you don't tell me, I'm just going to shoot you in your leg and I'm going to drive off.

And so like you, the guy was really hardcore. Yeah. He makes, you know, whatever the wolf of Wall Street looked like a small puppy. This guy's insane. Okay. Wow. Never heard of this guy either. How'd you hear about him? How'd you, how'd you find out about it? So when I tweeted out that I love like crime books and I think I had just finished, I forget what I had just finished, but someone suggested this book called Mastermind and it's by this journalist that worked at Wired Magazine and I've been reading this book and it's freaking crazy.

And even though this guy, what he did was wrong, it does like actually inspire me to like live a more adventurous life. Well, I'm like reading this and I'm like, why am I so fascinated by this? Like this is why I don't like watching a Wolf of Wall Street. I'm like, why does this excite me so much? Like I, I'm beginning to normalize this in my head and think this is okay. I can't watch this anymore, but I do think that there is a thing where like I can, I need to have a little bit more adventure.

You know, you could use it for good, but you know, I read it and I'm like intoxicated by it. Do you get that way? Yeah, I think that's why people love movies about, you know, prison, you know, prison breaks or they love it about bank heists and like why people play, you know, video games that have violence in them. It's like, there's definitely like a part of us that, you know, this stuff appeals to and like, you know, if you can get that outlet by just reading the book or watching the movie or playing a video game, like good, because you know, you didn't, it didn't translate in that, that kind of deep rooted desire for like, you know, either adventure, thrill, power, you know, you know, whatever it is, doesn't have to like spill into your normal life then.

Yeah. And it like inspires me a little bit in the sense of like, man, living life on the edge is crazy. I don't want to go to prison, but you should just add that to your bio. You know, top inspirations, Pablo Escobar, Paul Roo, Ross Albright. Yeah. So, but one of the reasons why it's interesting is the cool thing about criminals online is that you can read their correspondence. So like they get they when they arrested him, he had his computer open. And so they were able to like see a bunch of stuff. And that's I really love that this era about criminals and how you can like see it happening.

And that got me interested in the Satoshi post. So basically, if you go to like, if you just Google like Satoshi, you know, the guys created Bitcoin, if you go to Satoshi blog post, you can I was reading all of his blog posts. And what I found to be really fun is you go to his first blog post where he talks about introducing Bitcoin and you can go to the forum is still up. And I spent about an hour looking at all the people commenting on it and Googling all of them and seeing what they're doing and what they're up to.

And you could see them like reply like, Hey, Satoshi, you know, this is actually a really good idea. I've been tickering with this. I went ahead and purchased 500 bitcoins just to try it out. You know, I mean, it's really fascinating. The first few comments, I think weren't like, I think if I remember correctly, the original comments, like it's not like this thread blew up and people were instantly like genius. You know, this is a breakthrough. This is a genius idea. Right. Like that's not what no, it was like, this is cute. Right. And so like, like literally the first comment.

So, so, you know, there's, you know, Sepp Halsberger says, great stuff. This is the first real innovation. So this guy recognized it for what it is. This is the first real innovation in money since the bank of England started issue promissory notes for gold and the vaults, which became bank notes. I believe in open source currency has great potential. A bit like Google has become the default search engine for many of us. And then like, there's some people who are like, you know, I have questions about how it works. And then there's like how Finney who, I think how Finney got the first transaction like Satoshi sent it to him.

And I think he had the most questions about it, which is why some people think how Finney was Satoshi Nakamoto. And I think he was also the first one to like write out the like the total addressable market for it. I remember reading that one time where he's like, well, if this guy adopted like, you know, each one of these coins is going to be worth like over a million dollars, right? And he like broke down why, which is like, you know, to the party even discuss that now today, that sounds weird. Imagine 2009 year on a forum and you know, somebody posts this thing about how they're creating, you know, the new world money.

And you're like, well, you know, that means this little random thing that I could go mine on my computer, you could just send me 5000 of these right now. Like, yeah, that could each one of those can be worth a million dollars. And to me, that was really impressive. The people who saw it for what it is, which is like, you know, a true innovation, something that's great, something that could catch on. I'm pretty blown away by that. Me too. I think it's amazing when I read it, I feel inspired. And I think that's why I got obsessed a little bit with Paul LaRue is like, just these people who just have the self belief and vision, even if it's like a horrible vision and go out and like do it.

It's in there in the depths of the internet. It's really interesting. And this and I've been reading all of the Satoshi's forum posts and just seeing these just like, you can click and see these guys profiles, like they're wearing fedoras and like crocodile, like they're the nerdy, the nerdy, the nerd, the guys who like, I would dismiss and be like, oh, what are you like? Okay, nerd, like you're smart, but like you're just outlandish. I can't believe anything that you're doing. You read this and they're incredibly thoughtful and they like are taking it seriously right off the bat.

And I admire that. And it's a really, really fun thing to read. Yeah, I think it's on the, you know, I think it was like a forum. It was called the P2P Foundation or something like that was the, the original forum that this was on. It was like a Ning forum or something like that. And so, you know, the people who hang out in these types of forums, right? They're obviously like pretty hardcore either into peer to peer into cryptography into these different subjects. And so, you know, hanging out at the fringes, hanging out. I gave a talk recently for a bunch of people in the Midwest, they like zoom me in and they were like, we just want you to talk to our group.

And one of them asked, they go, you know, you said something about like surrounding yourself with interest, you know, like interested people, how do you do that? Like, what do you actually do to do that? And I basically told him, I go, I'm a pretty like normal person. Like I like catchy songs by Katy Perry. I don't have like great music dates. I like, if something's in the top 40, I'm like, oh, that's pretty good. You know, like, it's not like I have this like, this nose for the next big thing, but there are people who have that.

That's their superpower. And so I used to make fun of those people because every time they would do something weird, I would be like, oh, weird. And then I'd point out how weird it is. And I would kind of laugh at it. And they didn't really care because they weren't trying to be cool. Anyways, like I remember my in college, the guy who lived next door to me, this guy, Tophique, he was I walked in, he was like playing a video games like Starcraft or something like that. And he like turned to talk to me and the game kept going.

And I was like, are you even playing? Like, are you just, are you just, this is a computer? And he was like, he's like, yeah, I'm just, he's like, no, I'm watching the match from last night in Korea. I'm like, what? You're watching somebody else play video games is back in, you know, in what's that's been 2006 or something like that. And he's like, yeah, I'm watching a recording of his game. This match that happened in the Korean server. And I'm like, dude, say five more lame things like, you know, than that, like I'll give you a hundred dollars.

Tell me you're a virgin without telling me you're a virgin. Exactly. I was just like, oh, okay, like never coming in this room again. And then later like, you know, fast forward 10 years or whatever sell, sell our company gets acquired by Twitch. And all of a sudden my title is like director of eSports or something like that. And he calls me, he's like, you motherfucker. He's like, oh, Mr. E sports now, huh? And I was like, yeah, dude, it's a big thing. You know, you, you were on top of it. And like, I sort of, you know, I was embarrassed because like it was so true.

I was making fun of that behavior. And then sure enough, that becomes like such a, you know, like a billion, it was a multi billion dollar idea was watching other poop video games. And so I kind of learned how to learn the hard way many times of making myself, making a fool out of myself on that. We're like, now when I hear something weird, I'm just immediately like, let me pull up a chair. So tell me, like, why do you do this? Do other people do this? How often do you do this? Like, and the weirder it is, the more I want to lean into that phenomenon, because I know like it's just a matter of time until I discover that this is a like a totally normal behavior.

It's like, oh, you only drink soylent for all your meals. Like, oh, interesting. Are there, is there a community of people who do this? Yeah. We're called, you know, whatever bio hackers, there's a subreddit with like tens of thousands of us like, oh, interesting, you know, you can start to see that the, you know, the future is, is already here. It's just not everywhere. And like, how do you, how do you get closer to the future? You just find people who already live in the future do weird stuff and then you don't judge them. In fact, you just like complete, have the opposite reaction I used to have.

And this exercise of reading these old blog posts and all the commenters is, I think you just kind of put it in a little more eloquent, eloquent way. But that's exactly what's happening is like, you're seeing like, I'm trying to pattern recognition is kind of a stupid buzzword, but like you're trying to like see like, well, I know for sure that a, this sounds silly at first and B, it worked. So like, what does this like pattern of like people dismissing and like coming up with like, and how do I not make that same mistake? The guy that you talked about, what was the forum called? The P, here to P.

Yeah. I, so I, on the very bottom of the forum, it says like about, and you could like read who the owner is. And he is just a professor in Berlin or something. Like he's just a guy. And it's pretty fascinating. I'm like, man, like all these people were, it's, it's, it's like, you know, they, they, they, this kind of weird to say, but they're like, they were around when Jesus was around. Like, you know, like they like saw this like thing that like potentially changes what the next thousand years or the next 500 years of history and they like saw it.

And I think that's really fascinating. So dude, I put this in the milk road. I don't know if you saw this thing about like, so Peter, the big Bitcoin conference just happened in Miami. Yeah. Yeah. That was really, that was really good. On Friday, you did that, right? Yeah, I did that one on Friday. That was a Irish rated one. Yeah. That killed it. That was so good. But did you, I don't know if you saw the clip. I think I had linked to the clip in there of, so Peter Teal goes, he gives us talk at the Bitcoin conference in 2022 just happened and he, before he comes out, they played on the, on the big screen, this video that I had seen before.

I think I even talked about it on here once, but there's this video. I've watched a ton of old Peter Teal videos. So it's a video of him giving a talk in 1999 and he's talking about the idea of a currency not owned by, by the government. And basically this like this two minute clip of Peter Teal basically describing Bitcoin without saying the word Bitcoin. And he didn't know how it would work. But he's like, you know, the world needs a currency that's not controlled by, you know, the central banks of different countries, blah, blah, blah.

And I think PayPal originally that was their vision was to create a, they used to have shirts that said one currency to rule them all or something like that. It was like this, I original idea of PayPal was to create one global virtual currency and they shifted away from that later. Like, and he said, he at this talk, he goes, yeah, we went to something that was more practical and it kind of worked, but like it was less ambitious. And like, you can tell he kind of like regretted it, which is like, we, before we wanted to create our own financial system.

And then like, we settled on PayPal, and we settled on PayPal. It's a payments network that like, it works with your existing bank with the existing dollar currency and with your to send to somebody else's existing bank. So we're just like a funnel to like funnel the money through and like, yeah, that was cool. But like, man, this other thing was the big idea. And Bitcoin kind of proved that that was the big idea, you know, later on, but him giving that talk in 1999 to me is so crazy. Like that's one of the greatest like calls I've ever seen of just calling it with what's going to happen and why it's going to happen.

And in that talk, he's like, you know, the currency will live on your cell phone outside of a bank. You know, smartphones are going to be a thing. And you think about it's like, oh, 1999, man, iPhone came out in 2007. So he's predicting smart phone. He's like, we're already seeing the adoption of smartphones in Finland. And he also said, he gave a five year term and you're like, he it was 10, but he got it right. Yeah, he's like a billion. He's like, there will be a billion smartphone devices in the next five years.

It took 10 years, but like a billion devices like there was never a there was never a billion user product. Like there weren't a billion people who had computers ever. There weren't a billion people. I don't even think that use televisions. I think the cell phone was the first thing where it was like a smartphone was like the first thing where a billion people had this product. So of course, if you launch an app that works, your addressable market is a billion people who could download your app immediately. Like it's kind of an overlooked fact about why mobile was so big.

It's just like, well, there wasn't ever a billion people who could have used your product before this. Like their restaurant could never serve a billion people. Your store could never serve a billion people. Like McDonald's couldn't even serve a billion people no matter how many locations they open. Like the cell phone was really the first thing that was able to do that, you know, that quickly. And and so he's, you know, when he was talking about like smartphone adoption is rising in Finland. I'm like, who even pays attention to what's going on in Finland, dude? Like if I asked him right now, if I said point to Finland on a map, could you think you can point to Finland on a map right now? Like either.

And so it's like Finland, Denmark and like Holland and Sweden are all the same thing. Yeah, exactly. Like I don't know, dude. It's like that's where white people are. Why are you cleaning your nights? I get it. Like it's it's so like I thought about that. I'm like, oh, no wonder the people who were hanging out with Peter Teal went on to do like some pretty. Wait, hold on. What? Hey, ma, sorry, my bad. There's some like random guy like knocking on my window. All right. Sorry. Go ahead. So I was saying that, you know, it's no wonder that people hanging out with Peter Teal ended up going on to do amazing things.

Right. Like if you've ever heard of the PayPal mafia, it's like, yeah, like people who worked at PayPal went on to create YouTube and LinkedIn and Tesla and SpaceX and Yelp and Affirm. And like, I think there's like over $10 billion companies that came out of the PayPal mafia and like Kiva, like one of the best nonprofits came out of that. And so it's like, dude, why is that? It's because you're hanging out with a bunch of people who are already thinking about the future and living in the future. They're all weird nerds. And I remember one of the cofounders of PayPal, Max Levchin, he had this thing where he's like, he was interviewing somebody and the guy started like talking about how like, he's like, yeah, I love to play pick up hoops.

He's like, we're not hiring this guy. He's like, oh my God. He's like, he's like, no, no great program. I know, please pick up basketball. You said, well, that's what we said about the guys who are doing ICOs. We're like, dude, if your teeth are really white and you got abs and if you have a Ferrari and if your last name is also a first name, that's four out of four. You out like, like if your last name is or John to like, you're out like no state, John's exactly. And so, you know, these things like, I mean, you get canceled today for being like, I'm not going to hire someone who plays pick up hoops.

But like, and I think they even said something back then, they go, your goal as a startup is to basically build a cult. And they're like, the more cult like you can make your company, the better. And like, that's not popular. I think they've all they don't say that stuff in public anymore because now they're like, you know, bigger public figures. But like, I think that startup advice is actually fantastic startup advice. Now the cult doesn't need to be all people of the same race or gender or anything like that. It's like, people who are all believe like religiously in the mission.

And then people who kind of behave in a way that's like, they're willing to work way harder, sleep in the office, like, you know, they're willing to go to bat for this thing because, you know, they're like members of a cult, they sort of have lost them their own personal identity to the greater identity of the group. That is like a pretty hard force to bet against and beat. Dude, this gets me inspired. How, how do you think this was actually a third topic I was going to ask you, how do you think guys like Peter Teal who I don't know his background, but I think it was pretty modest.

How do people like him? How are they right so often? I mean, do they just make a ton of guesses and they're only read a couple of times, but I don't understand like that idea of thinking. I think I think big and then I like talk to or I listen to him and I'm like, oh, I'm like, I'm, I'm nobody. Yeah, dude, when you hear him talk, it's like when you're in a plane that takes off and all of a sudden the houses start to look like little toys and the people start to look like ants, the cars look like, you know, a little flex.

It's like, that's how my brain feels when I hear Peter Teal talk. I'm like, oh, I am a small simpleton. You know, I'm a single cell organism compared to this guy in terms of just like where my brain goes, how, how much conviction I have around my own original thoughts because like that's his thing, right? Like he's all about being a contrarian and, you know, I think Jeff Bezos said this about Peter Teal. He goes, yeah, that's the thing about contrarians. They're usually wrong, you know, and somebody else said like, you know, Peter's constantly predicting sort of like the end of the world and the market crash.

And like you just remember it the two times he was right in the 20 years and like the four times he was wrong, it just seemed like he was a little bit late on his prediction. And so I think there's definitely something to like, you know, being wrong a bunch, but it's like when you're, it's more like when you're right, you're right in a major, major way. And I think he was right about PayPal in a major way. I think he was right about Facebook in a major way, right? He was the first investor in Facebook.

He bought a 500, about a 10% stake in Facebook for 500 grand. All right. So like that was the best investment of the decade, I think, you know, like at that time. And so, you know, he was right in a major way about that. You know, the last time he kind of went on tour, he was right about two very contrarian things. One was Trump where all of a sudden like, he was the only guy in Silicon Valley that was like publicly supporting Trump went spoke at the, at the convention was like, we need Donald Trump to be president.

And at the time was sort of like Donald Trump was the underdog. He was not supposed to win. And like Peter, he'll pick that horse pretty early. That's kind of impressive. And like also he gets off on being contrarian, you could tell. And then the other one that he was right about was when he created the Teal Fellowship. So he basically went on stage, he had this, which was laughable at first. And he had, he had this talk where he goes and he goes, university, you know, college education is a bubble. It's the greatest bubble since the housing crisis.

This is right after the housing bubble popped. He's like the next bubble is college education and people are like, who goes against education? They go ask a hundred out of a hundred politicians, parents, anybody who's not pro education. And like he was the first guy to be like, college education is a complete bubble. And he explained why it was a bubble that like, you know, people go for basically this like certificate. This he goes, it's a, he goes, it's an insurance product partially. He goes, you know, it's an insurance for, you know, parents to buy for their kids so that they don't fall through the cracks of society.

He said, it's like a, a certification product. You know, you don't go there to learn. You go there to get your certificate. And so he's, he's was calling out college and then he created the teal fellowship, which was kind of a genius move because he put up, I think at the beginning, $2 million. But that $2 million was like $200 million of free publicity for himself because he, he made it bold. And he's like, not just like, here's an alternative to college for people who don't want to go. He's like, well, he explained what it is.

It was, he came out, he goes, I will pay you $100,000 to drop out of college. And it's like, oh, shit, you know, like keep this man away from my children. Like, you know, it was like a, seemed like a not good thing to do. And then he explained why is that college is, is, you know, a complete bubble. But then how do you get his money back from that again? I think he invested in the projects. I'm not sure. Well, for example, Ethereum came out of that, which is a $300 billion product, which is kind of ironic because he doesn't, he never claims victory on it.

And in fact, at the Bitcoin conference, he kind of shit on Ethereum, which is a bit weird. So, you know, I don't know why he's, I would think he'd be taking a victory lap because like Vitalik being a teal fellow was like the total validation of the teal fellowship. But I think Figma invested in owner.com, you know, owner.com diversity that company know about it. Yeah. He's a, he's one of those guys and about two or three more. I've invested in about three of them, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. I heard kind of mixed things about the project, the program itself, but like, there's no doubt like good stuff came of it.

Like if, if just Figma came out of it, the program was like a win, you know, like I'd say 10 billion dollars. Figma came out of it? Yeah. Damn dude. And so, you know, and there's many others. There's a bunch of other winners that have come out of it too. But like, so this guy's like been, you know, contrarian and right many, many times. It's very impressive to me. It's more impressive to me than people, like obviously he's very successful. So it's not even like that or success. But if you just showed me one person who's very successful and another person who is like an original thinker who's right when they go against the grain.

Damn. I'm more, I have a lot more respect and admiration for the person who was when it gets the grain and had an original thought that was right. Yeah. And it's inspiring. I was reading today and it said that this is like kind of a weird, a weird tangent, but Jared Kushner, you know, Jared Kushner. Yeah. So who is he? He's, he's married to the Trump or his brother is married to the Trump? Yeah. So there's Jared and Josh. Josh is the younger one. I think he's like 35. He's married to a model and he runs Thrive, which is a VC thing that's like immensely successful.

His brother is Jared, who I forget his title in the White House, but he was like Trump's right hand man and he's married to Ivanka. Yeah. And like a lot of people think he's evil. He probably is a little bit, he kind of has like a skeleton vibe to him, like a skeleton, the villain and he man or whatever it was. So he's like kind of has like a vibe to him, but he just announced that like a few months after leaving the White House, he he founded a $3 billion private equity fund. And like, regardless, you put politics aside, like it crazy that that's just like your thing.

Like you, you ended that you ended one like, like when I end a job, I take like a, a lot of people take like a three week vacation and they go start another job. That's like 20% higher in salary and a little bit better title. And like, he just like, well, like, oh, you know, I'm like, I've got some free time now. I'm going to like, you know, beep, pop, boop, just do this thing. It's a $3 billion fund. And like, I find that to be what it's the same thing of like, I feel like an aunt and you are not that you know what I mean? Yeah, exactly.

I know exactly what you mean. It does beg the question of like, you know, why do I not go bigger? And also, you know, is there a reason that I don't go bigger? Like, is there a reason Sam that you don't go create a $3 billion private equity fund? There's, there's two reasons. The first is fear. So like, it is scary to do that to like raise like for the raise outside failure. Yeah, to raise outside money and fuck it up. That's bad. But number two, I do think that there is, I don't know if Peter Teal has this, but Elon Musk for sure has this.

Did you read that article in the New Yorker or New York Times where he describes his life? He's like, basically, he was talking to the interviewer and he was starting to cry in the interview. And he's like, he's like, you don't want to be me. Yeah, he basically said, he's like, I miss my brother's wedding. I or he was like, I was about to miss it, but I flew in at the last minute. I saw it. He immediately got on the plane. He was like, there was like a time a few weeks ago where for five days I didn't leave the factory.

I didn't see the sunshine. I don't see my children. I had a birthday, but no friends came and said happy birthday to me because I was running around the factory and like I'm lonely and I'm pretty sad to be honest. And frankly, death, I look forward to it as a way of relief. That's like what he said. He said all that. Yes. And like the whole death thing. Bro. Yeah. Just do it. Just try it. A little advice. Brother to another. Well, and it's like, so I think there's one aspect where it's like, well, I don't want to like be this like the slave to this computer in the machine like F that and I want to live life.

But I do think that they're and I haven't formulated this entire thought entirely. I do think there's a world where you can go big and have some work life balance. So actually, so do you think that's true? Yeah, of course. Of course it's true. You just got to decide your terms, right? Like as soon as you decide those terms, watch, you'll figure out a way to make it happen or you'll find people who make it happen. I am so anti. There's one way to win or there's even one definition of winning. Like that's if I could just be the anti one thing, that's the thing I'd be most anti because I used to fall into a trap.

I'd see somebody doing something one way or I hear advice that makes sense. And then I'd kind of like this later in life, I found the counterfactual. It's like, wait, but this guy does do that. Wait, this this that lady did both, right? Like so hold on. If both is an option that I'm taking both every day of the week. It's only when I accept that both is not an option. I fall into this trap of misery of around picking one or the other, right? Of like lifestyle and ambition. So I definitely think you do both.

I play this game though. So I have two games that I play about any project that I'm doing. This is kind of like my I kind of exact coach myself. And I really always ask two questions. I go, I go for the first question is if I ask the southern founders to which is if I was to meet up with you, you know, if we hung out 12 months from now, we're grabbing a beer. And I'm like, Hey, what happened with that thing? What happened with trends? That was such a cool idea. Like what went wrong? What do you think is the most likely thing you're going to say in that moment where you're like, ah, dude, here's what, you know, here's where we, we messed up or here's what we turned out.

We thought that we turned out we were turns out was wrong. So it helps you identify the riskiest part of your business, either the riskiest assumption you're making, the thing you need to go validate or the risky path that you're going on where you're cutting off other options. So you're not, you know, you're really leaving yourself, you know, one move away from failure. So I always ask that question. And the way I don't know why, like, if you just ask somebody straight up, like, what's the biggest risk in your business, they answer it one way.

It's like, but there's other way with, I think people can relate to, which is like, if I see you a year from now, we're just grabbing a beer hanging out. It's like, and just let's just presume already it's gone wrong. What was the cause of death? You know, like, what do you think was the reason that so that's one. The second one, the game we played yesterday with the milk road. It was, it's called the, the why the fuck aren't you game? And it's basically it's like, it's like either why the fuck are you or aren't you, which is like, what part, if I was just an objective person looking at what we're doing, would I say, why the fuck are you guys doing this? Like, why aren't you hiring somebody to do that? It's taking you five hours a day and like you should totally you could, could you not find somebody to do that part? Or like, why aren't you like, why aren't you at this Bitcoin conference? Like aren't you building a crypto product? Like, shouldn't you be at this event? Like, there's just like this series of like, why are you or why aren't yous? And it's like, why the F aren't you, which kind of distills it down into like, what's the obvious good idea or bad idea, like good idea, we're not doing or bad idea that we are doing that I would criticize about ourselves.

And we both came up with a list of like three things and it became like, Oh, wow, we should just correct those now. Rather like, So then what's your answer? Why aren't you going bigger? Assuming that you're not going big, which is not a fair, a fair assumption, but for the sake of discussion. Yeah. So I wouldn't say why am I not going bigger? Like the Jared Kushner question you mean, or the questions I was asking just now, the Jared Kushner question. Because I want to have, you know, enough, meaning I want to have a, I want to be able to know what is enough and I want my vision of success to be bigger than just what's going on in my business.

So it's like, to me, if you set paint a picture of what winning looks like, it's not just a number in an account or a number in my sales dashboard. It's like, like I talk about this all the time. It's this perfect Tuesday. It's like my normal day is perfect for what I want. And that includes like, just like right after this, I'm going to go work out with my trainer in my home gym. Like that's a part of my perfect Tuesday. And if my business then requires me to not have time to do that.

And I'm like, getting fat or whatever, or it doesn't provide me enough money to be able to afford that, then it's not winning. Right? It's like, you know, being able to like take my daughter to swim class, like things like that. Like those are part of what winning looks like to me. And so I'm just not going to like deviate from that. I'm only going to, the only thing I question is not why don't I go bigger? It's, is this picture the picture I really want or is outdated? And do I need to update it? You know, and like, that's the thing I find myself being like, Oh man, I haven't updated this picture in a while.

Or there's just like a gap over here where I don't know what I want. What would it feel like to know what I want? Okay. Let me get, let me figure that out. Ben Wilson tweeted out, it's a superpower to know what you really want. Right, Ben? And that was, was that the tweet? Yeah. I really do. What did you see or hear that made you tweet that? So what I saw is that I have had a bunch of people reaching out to me recently and the people who were like, Hey, I'd love to connect.

I get so annoyed with, I'm like, you just dumped something on my plate for me to like figure out, which I just don't want to do. Whereas the people who are like, Hey, I really love what you do. I am also a podcaster. My podcast is this size. I want to get it to this size. I am having trouble in these two issues areas and I'd love to talk to you about it. I'm like, great, you know exactly what you want. I will, I will gladly give you that. And it's just, it applies almost everywhere in life.

Like the guy who comes up to you and is like, Hey, do you have any spare change? No, I don't have any spare change. Hey, I need $2.50 to get a ride home on the bus. Do you have $2.50? All right. I guess I got $2.50. Like it's a superpower in every way. So I like that you said that there's a tweet that my cousin put out yesterday. My cousin is on Twitter. Great guy. According to Twitter, he's killing it. I don't know. I haven't talked to him in forever, but like his updates, He's killing it at looking like he's killing it.

I don't know if he's actually going to have a caught up in the wild. No, I don't want. I'm not disrespecting him at all. I'm saying like his, like his updates are amazing. He just bought like 20,000 square feet or something. Like he's on top of the game. Yeah. And actually he did a good job of figuring out what he wants. Bro, you just called out your cousin. You should take that back. But I love my cousin. No, he's great. But I actually meant that as a compliment. There's a skill. There's a skill, especially in his blind business, which is real estate, there's a skill to putting forward your like putting your either your brain on brain forward, like sharing ideas.

Like he put out a thing of like, how I do diligence on properties. It's like a great checklist. It's like, Oh, you're just putting out great on point information. It makes me trust you. Makes me think this guy knows what he's talking about. Or if it's like, like our friend, Nick Huber does this too. It's like, he'll send us a picture of him smoking a cigar, you know, playing golf at, you know, one PM. It's like, wow, this guy must be killing it. Like you don't, you don't get to go out smoking cigar and play golf, you know, one PM regularly unless you're doing really well.

It makes me more likely to invest in Nick Huber's storage company that I know that he's doing well in life. Like some people take it as an anti signal. Like, oh, why isn't he working hard? To me, I'm like, no, if you're, if you're able to like do well in life, that means you're doing something right. And like your cousin tweet though. So he tweeted something out. He goes, I'm looking for like a car, like a new SUV. It's like kind of a general vague thing. And so he got any, that he like defined it right afterwards.

So specifically he goes the experience, you know, the, the user experience of a Tesla, the size of an Escalade, the, it goes with enough room for three car seats and a pair of golf clubs. And I was like, first of all, isn't it just a more fun way to look for a car? Like just to kind of imagine really what you want and like sink into the vividness of like just having it and not like worrying about the world. Tesla doesn't make a big car like an Escalade. No, fuck that. I'm not, I'm not grounded in reality.

I'm living over here in my reality of what I want. And he's only, he's got one kid. So I'm like, you know, three car seats, all right. He's planning ahead. Like that's good. And, and I just thought it was a great example of like specificity. So, so to me, a lot of people are vague in general when they should really be being specific. And then the opposite is also true. Sometimes people are like, man, I don't know what I want specifically. And they get tied up in a knot because of that. And my trainer had a great framework for that.

He goes, you got to know when to be general and when to be specific. He goes, if you like sometimes you will tell you, you need to be more specific with what you want. That means like the type of description my cousin gave about like, you know, the lifestyle that that what he described as a car is not just a car, it's a lifestyle. And, and then the second thing is like, when do you be, when do you be general? So he, so my trainer, I was like, well, what if I don't know what I want? Right? Like if he said, what, you know, what's your body goal? Right? His personal trainer.

I'd be like, well, I don't really have a picture. Like, I don't know if I want to, like I could say, I just want to have like a 12 pack, but I don't even know if that's true. Right? I'm like, I don't know exactly what I want. And he's like, cool, just imagine satisfaction. He goes, just, just first get to a place of feeling satisfied about it where you don't stress, you're not stressed about it anymore. He goes, he goes, you know, relief is a very powerful emotion. Satisfaction is a powerful emotion. He goes, most people feel relieved one time a day.

And it's when they poop. He goes, and now people bring their phone in and they're not even paying attention. They miss it. They miss out on the one moment of relief they were going to have that day. He goes, so I get good at feeling relief. I want to practice feeling relieved and satisfied because once you get good at feeling relieved and satisfied, you know what things you want. You're faster to figure out what things you want that will lead back to that emotion. And like, you're just better at being satisfied from a meal or a workout or whatever it is, daily things in your life.

He goes, let's, he goes, and so we made a deal. It's like, I'm, I'm going to be relieved more times than I poop today. And it's like, that's the goal. That's the first hilarious. This is all from your trainer. Yeah. What a smart ass dude. By the way, to talk about the real, what your cousin's doing on real estate, I've talked to a bunch of these real estate guys. So, and I'm friends with a lot of them, Keith Wasserman, Chris Fort, is that same? I think so. Nick Huber, Moses Kagan, your cousin's getting in there, the strip mall guy.

So there's like 10 of them that are like really popular, maybe 20. And I see the returns. They're really good. And the fees that they charge are crazy high. Or, but like, you know, who cares? I've been Nick's Huber thing. It's a huge fee, but like I'm getting a good return. So I don't care. It, this is one of the coolest things that's happening on Twitter right now is these real estate people are just crushing it all through Twitter. It's pretty amazing. I think some of them have shared that they bring in like tens of millions of dollars of investor money just off of people who are like, I'm a fan of your Twitter.

Yes. Which is like, that means if you're in real estate, like do what my cousins do, do what these guys are doing, like up your Twitter game, because it is going to lead to more deals and it's going to lead to more investors in your fund that you don't have to go knock on doors for. It's way easier to just tweet out stuff than it is to go like do one hour calls and seminars, webinars and in person meetups trying to like schmooze for a buck. Well, I have no idea how big Nick Huber, this is Nick Huber from sweaty startup.

I have no idea how big his portfolio is, but I wouldn't actually be surprised if it was over nine figures. And I bet you if it is, most of it came via Twitter. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if that's, I don't know exactly, but I agree with where you're headed there. And also that's also the one reason I haven't invested in a lot of these guys is because the fee structure, like, which might be to my detriment, but like one thing I don't fundamentally like about real estate fees is that they all make this like two, three percent like acquisition fee.

Yeah. Which like, you know, you will buy like a $50 million thing and it's like, so you just banked a million dollars in your pocket just for buying the thing, which leads you to an incentive, which is go buy more shit instead of being like really discerning between like a great property and a good property. It's like, just go accumulate. And like, I think Nick has a little bit of a different strategy because he's got to like a kind of like a template now of like, he buys the sub storage thing, it cuts out a bunch of the labor, he adds it, these automations.

And so he like has a playbook of how to add value that I think not every investor says they have. I don't think they really have it. I think Nick actually does a great job of that. But like in general, I would say one reason I've shied away is because I dislike this incentive, this incentive mismatch where like yours, your incentivize to take my money and go buy something because you get money today. That's guaranteed. That doesn't, it does not link to your returns. It's only linked to your returns over a long period of time.

And by then you've already banked these acquisition fees 15 times over by the time we figure out if these were good deals or not. And I have no idea if they're killing it because they're skilled, although many of the, all the people I had named, I, I've talked to, they appear skilled, but I'm a novice, but also they just happen to be in the game like starting six years ago and we're gone to like the greatest like boom in real estate. Yeah. So like, of course they're killing it. But the numbers are, I mean, I'm investor of Nick and I see the returns.

I'm like, Oh yeah, dude, I'll give you more of, but I'm annoying. By the way, if I was Nick, I would do exactly what he's doing. I charge the highest fees I can and be like, you're still getting a great return. Correct. All right. Fantastic. If you can go beat that return somewhere else, I invite you to do it. Which is like, you know, he's not as upfront about that, but like that's, I would do exactly what he's doing. So I don't knock him for that. I think that's a, it's what I would do if I was in that position where I know I can generate great returns.

But like on my side, I just I hesitate as an investor in that sort of thing, but maybe that's my detriment. Do you want to do more topics or do you want to save yours for Wednesday? Let's do, let's do a couple ideas. I think people, people like ideas. If you made it to the end of the episode, congratulations. All right. So let me pitch you two ideas real quick. One is called, I'm calling copy my trip. Okay. So I'm booking a vacation right now, taking the family on a vacation. Great idea. I, thank you.

Came up with it myself. Yeah. I love the business idea. I just put the idea of a family vacation. So I'm like, I'm like Googling. I'm like, okay, I want to go to Hawaii for example. So I'm like, all right, I want to go to Hawaii. All right. Which island? I don't fucking know. Okay. Which resort? Oh God, here we go. Got to figure out which resort and like, it matters. Like it's going to change my experience if I go to the wrong place or the right place. But like, and then I'm like, and then all the details in between like, okay, so if I take my kids, what do I do? Do I rent a car? Do I get car seats? Do I take the shuttle? Do we go on this activity? Is that age appropriate? And so what I want is my wife follows all these influencers on Instagram that are like mommy influencers.

And when they buy something, she's like, that's a good thing. I'm going to buy that thing too. And like, because she's like, look, we have the same taste. And like these people, they're not like, they kind of are promoting things that they like, they have a good track record. Like so she's like, bought a couple of the things that look good and they paid off. So she's like, now is more trust in them. I don't get why they can't or maybe they do this. I don't know. But like, I don't get why they're not just saying, copy my trip.

You want to go to Disneyland? Literally click this. And like, here's the like full itinerary of like, we fly into this airport, we take this transportation to this hotel because it's great for families for these reasons. We buy this thing, this thing, whatever. And like, I just get their whole trip that I can copy and that they have basically like a Tik Tok or like Instagram story version that I could just browse it to be like, Oh yeah, this looks fun. I want to do this. Like what I went on Expedia and I'm like, this is awful experience.

It's overwhelming. Here's an overwhelming list of 100 options ranked in five different ways that I click the fucking thing. I don't know if the reviews are real or not. I'm looking at the photos. They don't have all the photos. It's like a photo. It's a static photo from like a fucking airplane above the resort. It's like, dude, I just want to see like someone walk into the room and be like, Oh, this is really nice. The bed's good. You know, there's space over here and like, Oh, this is cool. They give you breakfast every morning.

Like check this out. You know, like, like an Instagram story, right? So I just think that there should be an interesting thing called copy my trip that anyone could do. It'll create a profession of basically professional travelers, like people who they go find the best path of how to have a trip to, you know, Bali or whatever. And like, Sam, you might follow somebody who's got like a fitness oriented angle. Right. Oh yeah, they want to like go. This person likes airbbs versus hotels. So I like aligned with them. And then it's like, they went and trained at this gym and got Muay Thai classes when they went to Thailand.

Like that's awesome. That's the type of trip I want to have. So I'm going to just copy their trip. Dude, I'm on board with that. We could do it. We do it for trips and weddings. Whenever I like saw my wife like working so hard on this wedding, I'm like, dude, just find someone else to just do the exact same thing. No one will know who cares. Or her younger sisters get married and I'm like, dude, just do exactly what we did. It was great. It was an awesome wedding. And of course, obviously they don't like that.

But yeah, just do the exact same thing. It was we all like great time. Right? Yeah, batch of parties. Yeah. Birthday parties. I want to copy or I want to copy your work, which is like, it's Pinterest, but just like the whole thing strung together. So how and like, and you would just do it where like, someone uploads a night in a rary and then you and you people rate it and you pay them money and buy it. Yeah, exactly. So so you don't have to buy the trip like just by doing the trip, those people get paid mad money from affiliates.

Like if I booked that resort because this person said this resort is awesome, I'm going to get a kickback of like all the things that they recommend now. It's pretty interesting. Some perverse incentive, but like everybody kind of offers a kickback. So I think you can basically through affiliates, you could monetize this pretty heavily for the for the creator themselves, which is what you can do is you could say it's not about like creator, you just recommend what you genuinely recommend. We're going to take the entire pool of affiliate fees and then pay it out based on who's trip got copied, even if that hotel doesn't have to pay you to like, you know what I mean? I would do something like that.

Where are you going? Hawaii. Oh, that's cool. And you haven't found a fictional example. This is a real example. And you haven't been able to find a trip. So first I went on whatever Expedia and I was like, God, miserable, don't want to do this. Okay, what else can I do? Okay, I could tweet this out. Then I'm going to get a bunch of recommendations. All right, that might work, but that only works for me because I got a big following. All right. I was like, how do people do this? And I was like, okay, let me go to, I was like, let me go look at like, you know, an Instagram person I follow, but like, they're not going to happen to post about it that day.

So like, it needs to be saved somewhere like a link in the bio of like, or like, you know, one of the Instagram story highlights, which is like, take one of our trips. And it's like, you know, they always do this, like, they do this with fashion. It's called like, I like, I buy like or some shit like that. It's like, if you like my outfits, you can go here and like, you can buy any of the items for my outfit and they get a kickback. So I say like that for trips. And then I went on YouTube and I was watching like, okay, you know, watch this like family vlog at a, at one of the resorts.

And I'm like, they're okay. But it's like this eight minute video and it's just that one aspect. It doesn't tell me about all the other shit that I could go do when I'm there and all that stuff. So anyways, I just think that elements of this happening is just somebody should make this like an explicit thing. I think I, uh, Jack Smith uses, uh, uh, VA's to do stuff constantly. And he, he's like, at one point he even had some VA's going into hotels into different countries and like taking pictures and sending it to him to let him know what it was.

But on a lighter, for real, on a lighter, outrageous thing. I've ever heard it's crazy and under a lighter, wait, did he pay for them to go on vacation? He found a local VA near. Yeah. He'd like, you'd find a local person. He's like, Hey, can you go to these three hotels that take pictures and let me know? And then he would like show them to his wife. Like, all right, which ones do you want? Uh, it was pretty. Dude, I'm calling him Jack LaRue from now on. That's kind of similar to that. Dude, he just sent me a picture.

Uh, and it was him and Andrew Wilkinson. And he's like, look, I, uh, with Andrew and they have their Ted talk badge on. And so they're clearly a Ted together. And I was like, Oh, how funny. And, uh, uh, yeah. And anyway, he, uh, does this all the time. And it's actually really interesting. And there's this company called trrr, flight Fox. You know what flight Fox is? It's, is that like where you'll just, is it like somebody will book it for, is it a travel agent or is it the one where you're like, I just want something.

Give me like the best deal. Like, no, it's amazing. So I have no idea how they make this work. So basically you go to flight Fox and you always have to click the button that says you're traveling for business. And then a person, you select like, I want to go around this, I want to go this day and I want to come back on this time, or you can even say, I want to go around this time. Um, and then you like, leave like notes, like I've got a budget, a blank, or I only want first class or, uh, I have to be back for a wedding.

So I have to make sure there's backup flights and someone on the other end pops up and goes, Hey, what's going on? I'm whatever. I'm here to help you. And it's a real person. And they go in, they find five to 10 different flights that fit what you want. And then you finally say, all right, this itinerary looks good. Or you could even reply back, uh, this one actually, I had to change the plans. I've got to change this, this and this. And they'll go and find flights for you. And they find the cheapest ones and they know what a search form and they only get paid until after you book the flight and they just take a $50 fee.

I have no idea how they make money. And then like when I was in Portugal, my flight got canceled. So I just logged on and I go, Hey, the flight you booked was canceled. Can you, you know, address it please? And they call for you and they wait on hold for you. And then you just pay them 50 bucks. It's amazing. I have no idea how this makes money or how they can make that work. Get it while it lasts. It's awesome. That's amazing. That's like, I think I told you about this thing I did once, mopoints.mopoints.com.

It's our, it's our, it's our good buddy Ramon's good buddy. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is like one of the best things I did. It's like, I booked this call with them. And so you go to mopoints.com just like mopoints.com. And basically it solves the problem of like what credit cards should I get? And so you just call this guy and he's like, all right, look, like again, you could just Google what credit card should I get? Guess what you're going to get? Like the most SEO optimized blog posts in the world because they can make so much money off preferring credit cards.

And you don't know if you're really getting the real deal. And so I just called this guy 30 minutes and he was like, all right, tell me about what you spend on and tell me what you want. Do you want to travel like a baller? Like he's like, look, I travel first class worldwide just off this. He's like, I'm not rich. I just but I use points to do it. Here's how. And I was like, yeah, I want that. And so he's like, cool, get the MX gold. He's like, you're going to get 4x points on all your Facebook ads for your ecommerce thing.

You're going to get one for you, one for your wife. So now you're going to get like 2 million points or whatever, like in the next year. He's like, then to travel, you just do this, you transfer points, like don't book within their points portal. Cause that's what I used to do. I used to go to my points thing and be like, uh, rewards flights. Oh man, I get like half a flight for all my chase points. Like, no, you need to transfer to travel partners. And then there you need to like check this out.

You use like KLM to fly, you know, here, here and here. And he's like, just call me when you want to book. He's like, for now, buy the MX gold, start racking up your points. When you want to book first class worldwide, just call me again. And I was like, dude, I feel so taken care of. This was like the best money I've ever spent. Um, just in terms of the, again, the relief of like, ah, I'm in good hands, right? Like the real all state I'm in good hands is fucking mo from mo points.

Dude, I'm a, I'm a fan of these businesses. I like the model of these things are typically monetized through affiliates, but instead you're just going to pay and I'll give you a more honest answer. I actually, I like that idea a lot. Yeah, exactly. Me too. I think it's great. And, um, and, uh, yeah, people should go sign up for that thing. Cause if you spend a significant amount on like for your business, it's like, I mean, it just makes financial sense to like optimize that. So you're either going to get the best cashback. Like, you know, I found out, oh, if I use this bank of America, platinum honors cashback card, I get 2.6%

back cashback, which is like way higher than anybody else gives you. Does that mean it basically adds 2% to your bottom line? Yeah, exactly. Like I take 2.6%. Yeah. So, so you know, if you're spending, you know, a hundred grand a month on ads, which is like very common for ecommerce to see is around, around number here. Now you're getting $2,600 a month back. Um, just straight to your bottom line, right? Like that just makes sense where you can reinvest that. A 5,000 person company or like BCG who sends people all around the world. Do they just have like a bank full of like points? I don't know what they do.

I actually asked my previous start up this, I'll go, I go, what do we do with all the points we collect? Who gets to use those? And I think they said that they just cash them, they just do the cash back basically or they convert them to cash, which is like not the most efficient way to use it. But like, you know, for simpleton, that's a fair way to do it. And they just like, you know, keep it. Who keeps it? Where's this money? I kept, I used our points at the hustle and I flew first class like twice a month.

It was sick. And then when I sold the company, I didn't have that perk anymore. I was like, damn, I got to pay for a flight for the first time in four years. It sucks. So you got to negotiate that in. I kept them. I got to keep all the points. We had like a million points, but I didn't get to, I didn't get future points. Gotcha. All right. That's it. I'll save my other ideas for the next one. And you got a crime, baby. Yeah. All right. Thank you.
