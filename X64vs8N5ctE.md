Duration: 1 hours, 6 minutes, 49 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

100% I've been saying this for a long time, which is anybody who could figure out how to employ the stay at home mom workforce It's gonna make billions of dollars Dude this morning my friend had a 40th birthday party and he rented out an entire water park this morning from like 7 30 a.m. To like 10 a.m. And I went to it Yeah, it was like me and Ramon and Neville and then like, you know David Perrell He was there and a bunch of other guys are there and I it was so fun We have this whole park to ourselves and then I came home and like threw up and went to sleep Like I you caught something cuz you threw about a nostalgia.

Why are you puking? I didn't like when I was a kid I used to love that stuff and then I did all these like slides and like went too hard and like going through them like I Like you go like these slides or it's kind of hard to explain But you're like in that you know those tubes that like going twisties Whatever like it just made me sick to my stomach. I I was like on the right home. I was like novel I think might throw up. I can you like unlock the window? It I can't believe how like all I got You savage you threw up out the window.

You know, I didn't do it at the window But I came home and I got sick and I just had to lay down. I cannot believe how Life has changed Like you didn't drink just just the straight just the action just the move just like the like what did you go to rides on Disney at Disney? Like that my daughter's too, so I did only like the Dumbo ride like the most simple rides I don't like I think I'm a little crazy. I think I would have done like the big stuff I think I would throw up at this point.

I couldn't handle it. It was horrible But man, this is why Austin is awesome. So like I okay, so David Pearl, I don't know him that well, but just two blocks up There's this restaurant and I would mean Sarah went out to breakfast and he was there And so I we knew who each other's were and we just said what's good. We're now we're gonna go hang out last night I had this guy over named Chris Williamson. Do you know who that is? No, he's like a popular youtuber and he just DMed me. He said I'm in Austin.

Do I hang out? I go. Yeah, just come over for dinner Like we're just like constantly just seeing people. It's pretty wild. It's a small weird It's like a lot of like cool people here, but it's a small town Yeah, that used to be the case in San Francisco, you know, cuz you would just bump into people everywhere That we're like doing the same thing like minded people who are also in the same game But I don't know I moved out of the city now. So like, you know, I'm in the bird My neighbor is 80 years old, you know, if I bump into him, you know, he's telling me about like crochet or something like that So it's not the same.

Well, it's it's awesome here. I've thoroughly enjoyed it You want to get into some stuff? Yeah, you have a bunch of really interesting things to talk about. I've got less interesting things to talk about Yeah, let's do it. Let's pick one Actually, let me tell me let me lead with mine because I have less stuff This is pretty much the only thing but you talk to this person. All right, this woman named Rebecca Zamallo. You talked to her, right? Yeah, I think you butcher your last name Zamorolo. I Zamorolo. Sorry. All right. So I did a call with her as well I DMed her and we and we start talking this woman is amazing So basically it's her and her husband.

Her husband's name is Matt. They're partners on this. She has a YouTube channel It's anyone listening to this. You only probably know about it if you have kids So it's meant for children. It's like it's like acting like fictional stuff age like six to eight six to tenish maybe where it's like It's not the like absolute beginner kitty cocomelan type of stuff It's like somewhere between and yes, they basically like it's a little show. It's a tea. It's almost like TV show You know, whether it's blues clues or whatever else there they create like, you know, these videos These are like 10 minute videos that are entertaining and on her personal channel.

She's got like 10 or 12 million subscribers She has seven other or seven channels total so six other channels one for her dog one for her husband one for like this For gaming just like all types of stuff. She's releasing eight videos a week They have a team of like eight or six people maybe and she kind of told me a little bit about some of like the business numbers My mind was blown. It was astounding. It was unbelievable. Did you talk to her about her business? We can't like I didn't ask her if I could say anything and she didn't like that But put that on blast.

But yeah, I like you know, the dog has ten times it maybe 20 times more subscribers than we do on YouTube. It's like, oh, this is my dog's gaming channel And it'll have like 400,000 subscribers or something crazy. So she gets YouTube has I mean 10 million subscribers There's no joke and the amount of production the content output like just that thing you said sounded like oh six Like seven eight videos a week. Okay, so they do a video they release video pretty much every day But they're like 40 minute long sometimes. Yeah, they're like long videos with like story lines about like and she'd be like, you know Yeah, we moved into this new house There was like this weird door in my bedroom.

So we created this storyline about this like secret Don't secret passage that takes you down and then there's a villain inside and the villain is my husband And like that's the like they create a whole play basically the little screenplay and they shoot it and while we were talking She's like yeah downstairs. There's like eight people for our crew like our kind of film audio You know editors whatever that are all here and she's like yeah, my life is crazy It's it was wild and she was telling me about different stuff. And so there's this guy named Dar man, so his first name is Dar DH.

I know him. Well, yeah, okay, so your friends with them Not friends with them my wife either knew him like in college or something like that or whatever but then we've Done some deals with him and his wife around like influencer content So he's got 13.8 million subscribers and it's it's kind of lame what he does like lame in that It's not gonna fit what we do but basically it's like hallmark channel videos like one was like bully Oh Someone bullies an autistic kid and the reaction is crazy or and it's like a fictional Hallmark video.

I think they like children watch it. I guess to understand like values and He's got something like a hundred employees and he's brand new to this like Within a three year thing. Yeah, like two three years a hundred employees and they pump these videos out to the point of like right now He's got six point three billion views and And it is crazy and across all their platforms their videos have been viewed 27 billion times It's the some of these youtubers it is I'm just blown away at how big their businesses are and when I'm thinking about it And I talked to Rebecca.

I'm like this actually isn't that hard I could do this and if you Dedicate like 40 or 50 hours a week if you start from scratch you can get big really fast And but you have to treat it like a job not a hobby just like anything else Yeah, like a business not even a job because yeah, I'm managing a bunch of people and you got to have a product for customers and things like that So so yeah, I totally agree like I'm on his Twitter. So It says like new videos Monday through Thursday family friendly kid approved, right? This is a that is a product you're offering We yeah, we release on these days.

We are kid friendly rated G You know like here's what you're gonna get out of this and that's that's you know my studio company or whatever And I think but by the way before this this guy I think he was doing like a cannabis company and ecommerce thing. Yeah, they have an ecommerce and cannabis business like unrelated Doing all kinds of stuff. It's amazing. It's incredible These youtubers like I'm blown away because there's so many that you have no idea who they are But they have these empires that could be potentially making tens of millions of dollars a year Yeah, I also think You know, it's really hard to do what they're doing like, you know the It's not for everybody and I I guess that's kind of obvious but I guess what I'm trying to say is even if you could do it not everybody could do it But even if you could do it doesn't mean you should do it like this is such a hard thing to do to get on that treadmill and say I'm gonna produce Awesome content five days a week Nonstop and if I ever stop the algorithm punishes me and my subscribers leave my channel and my patreon people stop giving me money And my I don't have ad content for my sponsors and if I ever, you know, just don't feel like being on front of the camera Like it doesn't work.

There's no substitute teacher to To you know step in here and step into this business. So I think it is a really valuable I think it's a powerful business when you have it because anytime you have the trust of millions of people who like your entertainment That's great. But man, I Don't think it's worth it, you know, just I I'm not even just saying that theoretically like I've thought about doing it and I'm like, there's no way this is worth it for me I and that's what I said to her and so this guy Darr I think he's not like the face.

I believe in most of his videos I don't think I think he's in close to none of his videos or something like that with her She was like, yeah, but we've got all these seven other channels now So we did diversified beyond just me and I agree with you I think that that's a hard treadmill But I would say to the the other side is like everything is that right if you start anything like Of course, you just kind of work at it for a long time. I think I could share this But when I did the episode when I recorded with husband Minaj who's like, you know comedian He's on TV shows stuff like that he he had asked me at one point during the thing.

I think the episodes coming out soon The he had asked me like, you know, like what would you do next step if you were me? And he asked you that yeah, like kind of like from a business point of view. What would you do next and? And on the pod itself, I don't think I got him gave him a great answer like I think and the pod we were talking more about like, how would you invest your money and I was like, you know Here's kind of the thought process. I would go down. It was kind of a boring lame answer I would to be honest, but afterwards when we were hanging out I Told him what I think is actually the real answer for this I said, you know, everybody should do what fits them like something that looks exhausting to me But look might feel amazing to somebody else.

So, you know, don't don't take my word for it But let's just pretend I'm just gonna give you my two cents and you could throw it away if you don't like it I said if I was you This touring business model seems awesome because I was at your show It was so that you know, like 4,000 seats sold out Everyone, you know, average tickets like 150 bucks and you just did that eight times in this city And then you're gonna go to 50 cities on this tour like you could just add it up and be like, wow you can make a lot of money touring and And and then there's no limit to that like yeah, this was a 4,000 person Auditorium, but you could do your same set in front of 30,000 people in a stick in a bigger stadium if like, you know Chris Rock or Dane Cook or whoever these other people would do that that size tours so I said you got a business model that works and But the problem is you're like as a year a new dad like me like I can't imagine being on the road going to 50 cities like We've been invited of many things.

I've been like, yeah, and then I'm like, ah Traveling is so hard little kids. I gotta leave my wife I don't really want to leave the house for an extended period of time right now like I like being home So I was like you don't for me. I would want to get rid of the travel component I said, okay, how do you do that? You can't have a substitute teacher come in and say your jokes on stage that doesn't work And so what I had told him afterwards I go if I was you I would stash cash and I would create a two year runway Where I could just work on one thing and that is creating the next Hamilton And he's like what and I was like I would use your storytelling your comedic abilities I would create Hamilton for Brown people because that's like his audience is as demographic is like heavily skewed Asian And I said, um, I'll create Hamilton for Brown people.

I don't know what that means I would just take that and say I'm doing that and Then he's like, you know, he reacted to it or whatever and I was like the reason I would do that is because then you get the Business model of touring, but it's not you on the stage Yeah, and you can sit back and you all you only have to create it once and like mama Mia has been running for fucking 16 years and has done over 600 million dollars in ticket sales and You know like Hamilton's done over a billion dollars in ticket sales and it's the same story It's the same songs.

It's the same jokes every night done by a different cast of kind of like, you know fungible or interchangeable pieces, so you're not super dependent on a one talent like you can switch it off So which switch out people if you need so I was like that to me seems like an amazing business model I would do that so that that's kind of my example of this YouTube thing is like You can also do the YouTube thing but in a different way like I think it's cool that Dar isn't the face of his videos So then it's more like a production company.

It's like a TV show. He's created not so much a vlog. Dude. There's this guy People are gonna laugh at me because I don't know if you know who this is is it Andrew Lloyd Weber I forget who I forget the guys name is that the fan of the opera guy Yeah, and did he do Joseph? Something Jesus radical. What's that that Broadway show where it's like radical Jesus or like Jesus is It's like about Jesus and they're like this Christ Super yes fucking it. Yes It's school of rock Phantom of the Opera and Evita which are all big hits that I've heard of and then I've never heard of Jesus Christ Superstar But yeah, that's apparently like done in the 70s.

Yeah, he he's a billionaire It Yes, so I looked up so when I thought of that play model is like is the play is the play business a good business It could be and I think it can be so the top the top IP Definitely a cruise like a shit ton of value like I said if you can go look at like Lion King is grossed like 2. Something billion dollars That's the number one stage play Two and three Hamilton is like getting up there. It's like it's like number two or three now But it's like very new so it'll it'll surpass Lion King if it just keeps going There's like Phantom of the Opera.

There's Mama Mia There's like if you take the top 10 and they're all doing like hundreds of millions and gross sales Okay, now you don't get to keep the gross sales, but I think you could do this in a way that works So like the guy who created Hamilton Lynn manual Whatever's a man. Yeah, but did the did the author get paid to on that one? So he gets so this guy Lynn who's the creator of it He has like a 7% royalty or something like that. Wow, so he's made like tens of millions of dollars off of the profits They actually crowdfunded the thing So what they did I don't have the full story in front of me because I'm trying to say this off top my head from memory But I think what they did was to raise the money to create the thing They had like a bunch of patrons basically chip in money and they all get to keep a profit share after a certain My amount of money had been recouped and so that investment has been paid over like 10 times so if again if I was house of knowledge I'd be like hmm his web 3 shit going on interesting a lot of people flush with cash buying into shit.

Okay, cool Digital tickets NFTs. Okay. What can I do with this and I would basically? raise $10 million through an NFT pre sale of the show and In different tiers like you know some of the tickets have backstage passes attached to them some of them don't whatever that's interesting And I would I would just let people buy buying this I'd raise 10 million dollars I'd use a 10 million dollars to go into a bunker to create whatever the health Hamilton black black people is and then I would Hamilton brown people for Indians. Oh, yeah, sorry that black people brown people So then I would take that show on the road and I would just try to I would be like yeah I know it's hard but like being a successful standard comedian was also like a point one percent success rate or whatever You know to get to where he's at so like yeah You want to get to the point one percent success rate, but this time with a superior business model that? Doesn't require your face on the stage saying the jokes.

Yeah, I think that's sick. I think that's a that's a great idea I think that actually that's wonderful. I think and that could be incredibly creative creatively fulfilling. I wish I had said it On the spot It's like one of those when you're in an argument and then like later you're in the I said that fuck I should have said that that's what happened to me But luckily we're still hanging out at that moment. So I was able to tell them you know then this is a cool idea I think in the next couple episodes what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna bring in I'm gonna do some research on the Broadway business or like theater.

I guess what do you call it theater? Yeah? It's actually an interesting idea I was always curious because American idiot basically they did this so Billy Joe Armstrong wrote Green Day wrote American Idiot the album the song they turned it into a Rock musical right you didn't have to be there. They didn't have to be there You know exactly and they got paid a lot from it book of Mormon. Let me see how much Book of Mormon has made 500 million dollars has been the gross ticket sales of Book of Mormon and then if you did something like a Hamilton or like a Lion King or whatever You could take that same IP those characters you have merch you have like other that IP is you okay? is you got to own the IP and You know so so I think you know when that when Book of Mormon launched It says it was bringing it bringing in 19 million per month So like I don't know what South Park generated lifetime, but like I bet it's kind of like on par with that Or you know, I guess South Park's probably a bigger success Yeah, oh Wow South Park Okay, just in 20 I didn't know this happened actually looks like a couple months ago the South Park creators signed a 900 million dollar deal for more episodes for for six years With Viacom CBS.

That's insane. I didn't know that that's actually amazing That's amazing right now is the best time ever to be a like a production company or an IP holder And we said this a long time ago remember I said someone needs to there's all these platforms now You got I at the time it was Netflix Amazon Prime and then I said Disney Plus was gonna come out It hadn't come out yet And then there was like, you know, there's Hulu. There's all these different platforms Apple TV Plus came out They all want original content. They're all hungry for content and they are betting billions of dollars Budgeting every single year to buy content.

I think Netflix or Amazon or something They're paying like six billion dollars per year for content for new content production And so it is the best time ever to be a seller of content at the time We had said somebody should create YC for content Basically the way that Y Combinator helped produce software startups and it just said hey two engineers Okay, you're 21 years old you graduated from Stanford. All right come here This is essentially like a business school, but you're gonna create a little business and you know Maybe you can sell to Facebook or Google or you'll end up becoming the next Airbnb you'll go public I think the same thing with the content where you come in as two kind of like creatives You have a pitch for an idea of a show you want to create You have three months to basically create the sizzle reel or the pilot or whatever And then there's a demo day with a bunch of buyers from all the big streaming platforms and they just buy options on your shit and I just think that's a beautiful.

I still think that's a great business idea and it's only been proven when South Park signs a $900 million deal with CBS Shonda Rhimes, I think signed a signed a couple hundred million dollar deal with Netflix to produce six shows Reese Witherspoon sold her production company, which didn't even have that like a billion for like a billion dollars Like this is you know, this is tech startup money That's being sold for for TV content, which is amazing. So, you know, that's a way more fun than building software Way more way cooler Way cooler than that and I think today has a man also announced his production He created a production company today announced it like a hundred things called hundred eighty six K productions or something like that Which is smart again like once you see Reese Witherspoon and other people's production company selling and we had Rob Deer dick on I think he said he sold his production company for 200 something million He said that he I think he said he's walking away with a hundred him personally Yeah, so like I think you know, at least let's say at least a hundred million probably closer to 200 million He sold his production company, which basically just produced shows for MTV That's a great business to be in and I think it's only gonna get better for like this kind of five year period And then these platforms are gonna go away like Paramount Plus and you know, like Quibi died You know Paramount Plus with the fuck is that that's good? I love Paramount Plus Why do you love Paramount? What's the one show you love on those gotta be one? They have like a lot of documentaries and shit Paramount.

It's like old older It's like old school a little bit or like peacock. You are you subscriber to peacock? Hell. Yeah Peacock I literally was just when I was laying in bed when I wasn't feeling good I watched the office on peacock peacock is the only place that you can get the office He sees one right? Yeah, you could you at the office in parks and rec It's the only place you can get it and then it's all I use it for parks and rec the office and AP bio Or have you seen AP bio? No, I don't know what that is.

It's like with the class I took in high school. It's like the main guy from it's always sunny, you know, uh, these brother Dennis. Yeah Yeah, it's sick, but peacock's good man. Peacock. It's just it all costs so much money It all I was looking to shit on one of them. I thought peacock was safe, but I guess peacock school You're sponsored by peacock. I guess I don't know what's going on. I pay I pay for all of this man a free subscription You want to do so let's dude you have so much stuff here.

Let's just bang through it. Yeah, let's do one Okay, so let's do Do this tweet thing Okay, let's do this tweet. So this guy Sue Hale who created mix panel and now is creating mighty Which is a cool company. Have we talked about mighty by the way? Yeah, it's pretty awesome. I think we talked about it So, yeah, let's skip that for now. Anyways, good entrepreneur cool guy, whatever he tweeted this thing out and My tweets not loading right now, but I think it was something along the lines up It said the truth. What's a company you'd start if you had more energy time or a lot more money Right, which is basically like if you took away your bullshit ass reasons What's the thing you really should be working on right now? I find that to be a very interesting question I have another question that's similar to that.

So maybe we'll do both these questions today So I went through the replies and I want to read you Five of my favorite replies and I want you to just give me a gut reaction Hell, yeah, hell no, or I don't fucking get it. Okay, so the first one came from Gary Tan Who's a you know big shot investor guy? First investor in coinbase made like a billion dollars on that. So he said a reference check network You know what that means just when I say just that yeah, yeah So well the problem being solved is how to get like if he's gonna want to invest in someone Hey, does anyone know is this person honest? Right or you're hiring somebody and you want to know okay? Yeah, you worked at this place How do I get a reference check? So normally today you ask the employee they give you three names Of course those are the three people that are only gonna say good things which is kind of annoying into the first place So you can't really get the right people then you kind of have to bug them There's no real incentive for them except for to maybe help out their their ex employee And then you have to think of whatever questions you're gonna ask most people ask pretty poor questions But there are better ways of doing it and in the end you're just trying to get this fuzzy picture of like You know is this person any good or not so that can be done better and I think he had some solution in mind Which is like something on the blockchain which was just like You were able to like I'm able to have people who are linked to me Somebody can go and request a reference from them.

Maybe there's a little payment made I'm not sure and then they share information, but it's not publicly shared It's just shared privately with me given the context of you know, who's who's the employee and what what this That's cool. I thought that was alright I thought it was really really specific one. I thought was cool because there was a lot of like I'd solve clean energy And I like I don't really know what yeah, yeah, like it's not that that's a bad mission It's just like what the fuck am I supposed to say about that? Okay? Somebody else said create the largest employer of high school students in the US.

What do you think of that? Sick sick. Yeah, I mean that's like that that sounds awesome. Yes. I mean, what is that now McDonald's? Yeah, like I mean, I mean probably honestly, I guess it might be like McDonald's I don't know what that would be. I talked to these guys who were building a company I forget what it was called. You probably know what it was But it's basically like an id indeed comm but it's meant for teens and it looks like tic toc and like Panda Express and McDonald's and Like PacSun were all advertising on it and you could like scroll through and look at job opportunities Yeah, I want to say it was called like peach something or like lemon something or something like that I don't remember I don't remember but Panda Express was like spending a ton of money on it And so anyway, yeah, I think that's cool.

I think it's a great idea It's a great prize to go for I actually would say that this is like an interesting framework Which is who do you want to employ? 100% I've been saying this for a long time Which is anybody who could figure out how to employ the stay at home mom workforce is gonna make billions of dollars So if you just work backwards from there's a bunch of moms who are at home They want to earn a little extra income doesn't have to be a ton They want to maintain flexibility of being able to stay at home and work not like necessarily a fixed number of full time hours or the same hours every day who can solve that problem and There's only one example that I know of that's solving that problem.

I don't know if you know any For moms. Yeah Maybe user voice comm I think they do it User testing user testing that's the one I was thinking about. Oh, is it really my mom work for them? Yeah, so Oh my god, that's so funny. I knew about it. What a random thing that we both knew that So I would say so you just testing outcomes amazing company by the way So you just pay someone to like go through your website public by the way And how cool is they just went public and my mom stock and my mom was like well say what it is So user testing basically it's a service where I have an app or a website.

I want to know Where it's confusing for users like design makes sense to me But like sure enough when you when somebody else is using it they're confused They can't find the thing they want and they just record your mom like scrolling through the site So they have army of testers, which is just all the requirement is be a normal person You have we do not even want you to be highly skilled like you're supposed to represent the average customer So they have a bunch of people they send them a little camera that that the records their finger on their phone Basically it records them like and they just talk out loud so that you give a task you say like you know Find a Christmas gift for your dad and put it into your cart and they're like, okay.

I'm looking for the gifts for dad section I don't see it a scrolling scrolling scrolling. They don't see the button that says menu. Oh, there's the menu Dad dad. Oh, it's men's men's. Okay. I'll click men's Yeah, I don't get how this is sorted. Oh, this is by new release and you just talk through what's confusing to you And that 15 minute video goes to the company and the company gets to watch it and they get to share it internally They're their researcher basically shares with the designer or the engineers and they pay like $300 for it, right? No, no each test is like $25 or $30 and then and then now it's all switched to subscription But originally it was like $25 $30 a test the tester gets 10 bucks for doing the test and the company kept, you know 15 20 bucks and so the testers like cool I could do like four of these in an hour and so a tip like a bid would come online Oh Chipotle wants you to test their new mobile menu and you would just have to go quickly say yes And then you qualify they're looking for women, you know age 40 to 55 in the US and you're like, yeah great I qualify I can take this test and that's a billion dollar company now.

It's market cap is over a billion dollars Did your mom get paid? Did they give her shares? Yes, awesome So basically my mom was she first started off as a tester Then she got hired by the company to review the other testers because you have to do quality controls So she became like she would watch the test and give feedback to the testers of like hey Your audio sucks are like you're mumbling or like You didn't follow the instructions of the test one more strike and you're out of the testing pool and so that was her job and She was the oldest person in the company I think so she was like my mom's like 63 now so she just retired this this year So she was there at 62 years old My mom like had slack and like knew how to use all like Jira She knew what a Jira ticket was like it was crazy my mom like who knew and And she got some shares and she had always told me like should I I was like yeah you want the shares for sure and then she would tell me like Hey, the CEO did it in all hands.

He said this this is this is that good? I'm like yeah, it sounds good like this company's doing well I should have bought secondary stock in the company during that time because I had like basically inside info like this company's pretty good There's a good quality company and I was a user of the service as well so it goes public the other day like two weeks ago and I'm like mom how many shares you have and she goes looks in card as she's telling you share like mommy made $150,000 no way and she's like yeah cuz her strike price was super low she was there for like four or five years and So I was like that's amazing.

That's like like that's that's my mom was so happy Yeah, like good for her that's bad ass money and so like this is why I think this model of who do you want to pull He's actually interesting because it's actually There is two for two reasons. It's motivating. So like the fact that like they are employing Most like I have no idea I'm just make this up if it's like mostly women who stayed at home for a long time And now they want to get back to it. That's like incredibly motivating. It's like look we're serving our employees.

Yeah, it's very noble It's cool. Let's say you want to hire Ex cons or something. It's like look, this is interesting or we're gonna hire a bunch of 16 year olds and it's gonna be the first job We're gonna train them how to be Men and women and prepare them for the rest of their lives. It's actually incredibly cool. It's fascinating There's one I want to look up the name give him a shout out here. So it's higher you hire military wives as ea's that's awesome It's called and it also helps with expectations. So you know what you're you know, what's it called squared away squared away That's basically a woman.

I think I think her story is that she I'm assuming she was in this position I don't really know but basically it's military spouses I was like, this is a great. This is a great idea Because you know, this is us These are us employees. They want this work. They Yeah, you know, they it's great to provide for their family while the husband's away. I think it's awesome and And it helps significantly with expectations because then user testing knows all right We're mostly gonna be hiring 60 year old or 50 year old women who don't have a probably a ton of experience with slack and Jira So now we know what we're getting into or processes.

We know how to hire the culture is good They all get along. Yeah, it's like sit like mindedness or if we're hiring a ton of 17 year old high school kids Like we know like here's the deficiencies and here's where they kick ass or if we're hiring guys out of jail We know like here's where they're gonna struggle. Here's we're not gonna show. So that's cool What are what are some other great ones on here? That's a good one. It's kind of vague but pretty cool I'll do two more Okay, we'll do one VR therapy so VR is not there for like mainstream use cases and the average person not coming home and spending a couple hours of VR There's a few you know, there are some people who do it.

They like to play games but VR is really awesome for like For like training like I know doctor like medical schools buy it so that the doctor can be like in the operating room They can make a highly lifelike simulation And I think therapy is a good one too. So Being able to put a headset on and really like change your environment change the state of mind be able to go roleplay Through scenarios or talk to somebody and feel like you're there with them I think that's kind of amazing and so I look forward to seeing like VR with these like really specific high value use cases Until like the mainstream thing is ready dude.

I'm down with that. I also think I could conquer a bunch of phobias like with that Right, so I'm down. I think that's cool. Like I know that like athletes are doing this. So like, you know There's this great. We both love like, you know, UFC at MMA and NFL is this way also But there's this phrase that Conor McGregor's coach always says which is you want to upgrade the software without damaging the hardware So it's like how do you train and improve? Without the without putting strain on the body hurting your body because training is so physically grueling So one way that they're doing it in the NFL is VR headsets the quarterback instead of just watching film their first person Reading the defense without having to go stretch get their ankles taped up go out on the field potentially, you know Spraying a knee or get hit.

It's like they get to they get to read practice reading the defense and all the different coverages Just in VR and then when they get out there on the field Like it's that same first person point of view turn being able to turn your head and you're you only seeing parts of the field like it's like Pretty much like a one to one recreation. I think that's kind of awesome. I want to know which company's doing that I'm sure there's a company doing that my favorite videos on YouTube to watch right now are they take folks who play Simulate racing sims so racing simulations with VR sets and they have these like amazing setups at home that are like 10 20 $50,000 and then they go and put them in a race car and They do really good.

No, they do really well, you know, they it takes them like in all the videos I've seen it takes them 5 10 20 minutes to like get used to the noise and get used to Like the smell and just the slightly different sensation But they pick it up super fast And so it's guys who have actually never raced before and they get them out there and they give them the fast cars And they pick that shit up. It's pretty amazing Yeah, like I think even stuff as boring as sales I think you could practice sales in a much more lifelike way I know that teachers are doing this for like How to talk to your student about if they're feeling depressed or if they're being bullied It's like you sit there a student walks in you can see their face They're saying something and then you have to react and then you have to like you kind of like choosing what to say live It's it makes it you get to practice before you go do the real thing.

That's cool. Any other good ones? There was a couple other ambitious ones. So there's a terra formation one. We've talked about this before which is taking just Deserts on the on earth and turning them into like rainforests basically turning them into forest I put it creating a green oasis of trees there and like that cleans up that sucks up a bunch of carbon dioxide from the environment So it cleans up, you know, the the air as well as like turns it into livable land And so like if we can learn how to terraform which is basically like turned, you know, unlivable land into livable land That's gonna help earth But it'll also help when we finally do make it to Mars and we need to turn that into a hospitable place We're gonna need to know how to do terra formation So I thought that was kind of interesting and there's another one like that like drone based wildfire fighting So like sending in drones to put out wildfires.

I think that's pretty cool, too. I think that's great. Those are really neat What um, what's what's another one? What's this legal question for five million dollars? This I thought was cool. All right, so there's so as you know, I'm a tick tock binger nowadays and tick tock is the only social media that like I When I leave it, I feel better than when I came in everything else like Facebook feel awful at the end Instagram I feel like I'm out of my brain brain is rotting Twitter. I'm like, I was a waste of time just dealing with a bunch of people's bad thoughts and Tick tock is really I cannot believe how much I enjoy it.

Like it's entertainment It's entertainment, but there's a lot of education like I learned a lot of shit off tick tock now. It's all little life stuff It's like I don't know stupid examples, but like hey if you ever take a photo and you see that like you know where you're like When you take a photo your eye can have like a red like you know You look kind of the evil like the camera has that flash or whatever like a red dot if that's ever white you should go to the doctor Because there's actually like a very like there's a chance that that's a very bad thing And then this guy was replying saying actually I had heard that I saw the photo like the end of that I went to the doctor.

I turns out eye cancer is like I actually have my eye removed But like it saved my life that we found it early and I don't know this is random shit That's that to like, you know just quickly seeing like how an avocado gets to your door It's like oh cool this farmer farmer tick tock is dope like Parenting tick tock is great. It's like oh when your kid is just not listening How many times have you done this? I'm like, yeah, fuck that's me and they're like here's a better way to say it I'm like, thanks, you know parent.

I never had to teach me how to do this really important thing in my life I'm like you just learn little shit. So Anyways, I was on it and there's this account called legal baddie Legal baddie is this like some hot lawyer and she's like here's my question for you She goes if I told you that you were gonna make five million dollars a year as your salary regardless of what you do So you're just you were gonna work 30 40 hours a week. You're gonna make a fixed rate of five million dollars a year What would you choose to do as your work? but you still have to work to get it what would you choose as your job and Obviously, this is like, you know a hidden question of kind of like what do you actually really enjoy to do if money wasn't an issue? And so and but you still have to work, right? So there's one of like oh if I had a hundred million dollars Well, then I probably maybe I wouldn't work at all like maybe I would just do blah blah blah This is like you have to work to earn this But no matter what job you do, you're gonna earn the same amount.

So which job by the way, I'm looking at a profile I love legal baddie. I love this woman Why? Just her luck. What do you like? She's just like she's baddie. She's this one's a lawyer. Is that her her shtick? Yeah, she's I think she's a lawyer. Otherwise, I just think it's legal means something else If this one she's 19 and that's her first gen lawyer from UCLA law I think it's amazing. She's probably making more money off tiktok and like she's like I like I like I Particularly like it with women, but I like it with men too where they Talk about like cool shit like passing the bar exam or whatever, but then like like she's got all bunch of nail shit I always think it's cool We're like you can break that barrier of like smut and cool stuff and also like legitimate Life helping content.

I always thought that was cool. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I'm with you She has 500,000 followers on on here and like, you know her top videos Yeah, she's like doing like like purposely hot girl stuff and then also like telling you how to get into law school I always think I always think that's cool law school and then down her dog Then back to quick bar exam tip and then back to my favorite name and like here's like a bit Here's like a pretty racy bikini video of her So yeah, she knows what she's doing right like let's credit where credit is due She is giving the market what it wants.

I love this differentiated thing She's not just one of the like kind of like tiktok hot girl and a bikini or whatever like she layered it with Another like that what this the skill stack as you call it, right? How rare is that? There's there's not a lot of lawyers on tiktok. There's not a lot of hot girls Both she might be the only one right so she's competing in a pool of one And there's this video of her talking in front of like c span like some type of press cop. I love this anyway I love her so what's the question five million dollars? What would your job be? Yeah, what would you do for your job if you were for sure gonna get paid five million dollars? What would you just choose to do for that 30 40 hours a week? What's your answer now? I want to hear yours first I don't know what comes to mind Five million dollars a year and you have to have like a 40 hour a week job, right? Yeah It's definitely something involving like charity so like something involving not making money So if I can get five million dollars and all I have to do is like spend time like running a dog shelter or I Would do that in a heartbeat if I get paid I Like a dog rescue I would do that in a heartbeat or to help inmates ex inmates find jobs I think that would be exciting some or even like people like everything we just discussed about helping Stay at home moms get get employment anything that involves helping people and not making money.

I would do that Yeah, that's good. Yeah, mine's kind of similar. Mine's kind of boring. I would probably teach like I just love teaching so I Would teach now the question is what would I teach? I think I would teach kind of like business slash life stuff to people who Want to actually like they're really motivated to have a great life and have a great great like kind of business career and so those are the people I like hanging out with the most and That's the thing I like doing the most is basically learning shit and then just You know packaging it up and then teaching each other's an answering questions, you know talking things through basically with people figuring stuff out So I think that's probably what I would do, but I feel like you know your dog shelter thing made me think Oh, maybe there's an even more lightweight Just pure enjoyment like maybe actually I know what it would probably be I would be like a I'd be I'd be a basketball coach or I would be like a Like whatever the F minus basketball league is like I'd be a basketball player That'd be something that I have the absolute most fun doing is playing basketball and like second best would be Coaching a basketball team this woman legal bad.

He has another question. Would you rather have $10 million today or a hundred million in five years? That's the easiest question ever. Which one would you take a hundred and five? Yeah, exactly 105 is great It gets if it's 50 I think it's a lot closer It gets a lot closer at 50 because 50 could turn into a hundred and five years in a bull market 10 10 will turn into 20 But also you got to have 10 now and you didn't wait five years of your life, which is you know pretty significant? But yeah, I think my answer is I'd be on some Gordon Bombay shit I'd go do my mighty ducks thing with some like, you know high school team.

I think that's a good answer You want to do a few more? Let's do something else. Let's do it. Let's do a couple ideas. So business idea. All right problem I just ran into Sending a gift to your production partner your factory partner overseas, okay sending gifts in general is hard sending gifts overseas even harder Because like just like the act of mailing things and like I want to send them like, you know Bottle of wine for Christmas or what it's like. I can't mail that. How do I do this? I gotta look up UPS is like alcohol shipment, you know rules and make sure it doesn't crack and all this So I felt I was searching like I'd like to send my factory a gift in China Is there just like a version of DoorDash in China? I could just like Go look at what they have push a button and they'll just deliver it to them and like that's done and I actually found this like really janky website I'm gonna find Find the name of it But basically I found this like old school looking Craigslist looking website and it was we send gifts to Your business partners in East Asia and it's like that's all we do Browse here's like 50 gift baskets ranging from like balling out to like we just met and You know you want to spend $40 you want to spend for $400 you could you could pick and they just say great What and then their address field is like formatted for Chinese address It's like, you know, like it's like it's just it's optimized where you have confidence that they will actually deliver the goods I'm not gonna have to worry about logistics I'm just gonna be able to put in some money and I'm gonna have a thoughtful gift to my factory partner So I like this idea because okay, there's probably some amount of people like me that are searching for this like okay It's Christmas.

I want to get gift for my business partner, but do they not have can you not order an Amazon thing and send it to China? No, I don't think so. I don't know. Maybe I maybe I could have just done something as simple as that I don't think I don't think so, but maybe there's like maybe I needed to go on Taobao and like figure that out Yeah, but that's a pain in the ass because I think that's how it is exactly this was like pay with PayPal You're done and I was like great. This is what I wanted and it was also like organized as a gift So it wasn't just like an an item where they're just gonna get it in a shitty Amazon box.

It's like it looks like a gift It's in a gift cat hair package Which is nice. That's like the goal of what I was trying to do It's like edible arrangements to China is what I was trying to do essentially so I sent it and And I was just thinking you could just do this and then do like cold outreach to like the 1 million Shopify stores and be like Hey, you know, it's a good idea You should send your your factory, you know, your your manufacturing basket a gift basket and like, you know, cost six bucks It goes a long way, you know, these people, you know, they're the key to your business and study shell blah blah And gifting is a big thing in China.

It shows respect. Don't be rude And like you could do that three times a year like oh, it's that's Chinese New Year It's whatever else and I think just through outbound you could create like a probably like a one million dollar a year Revenue business maybe three million dollars a year in like two weeks. I think you could create that So our listen to this crap. So so the other day we got a mattress delivered to our front door a Zinus mattress, it's huge and it had Sarah's name on it I go Sarah, why'd you order a mattress because I didn't order a mattress I'm like, we gotta find out who set this mattress because we can't open this up because if you open it up It's a pain the butt.

We're just gonna keep in the box Maybe send it back or we'll sell it for like $200 or give it to a friend. Yeah It's like a heavy ass huge box huge that you can't open and you don't know where it came from Yes, and it says Zionist. So I know it's a cloud mattress. I don't even know what size of mattress It is okay. I got open it up and she posts on Twitter and Nick Huber sweaty startup says that was from me And it I go oh very funny and he goes no that was seriously for me We wanted you to know I invested into his storage business Yeah, and he said we wanted you to be able to sleep well at night knowing that your money is Like being taken care of but I was like Well, I appreciate the sincerity.

That's lovely Yeah, who the hell has a like I don't have like a spare Unmattress bed. Yeah, like I don't have an unmatress bed Like what were you thinking like maybe a blunder would have been cool or like just chocolate like like a pillow Yeah, like a fancy pillow I could use another one of those he gave me an extra mattress And so we've been texting our friends like does anyone need a mattress he created a pain in the ass for you Yes, I'm like dude. Just send me chocolate covered nuts There you know what I mean like Give me like like some flavored like some weird fruit or something.

I don't want to fucking mattress He sent me a mattress. I've got this huge mattress in the front door I found problem and I've got guests coming on Friday, and I'm like look at like a redneck with mattress my friend We have a bed they're staying in the bed It's already in the guest room, and I'm like look like an idiot I look like a country bumpkin with just a mattress on my front door, and I'm like oh just ignore that we'll get rid of it And so I'm on board with better gifting Nick Huber.

I this will make it to you I I really appreciate the the gesture though. It was very nice But like maybe like peanut butter cups and like chocolate covered nuts and like some chocolate turtles would be more sufficient All right, so that's one quick idea the factory gift idea with the outbound outreach to every FBA and Amazon seller And I say a Shopify seller and I think you could I think you could side hustle your way into a million dollars a year doing that Okay, here's another random thing. Have you have ever seen? EMF protected pants is that for your computer on your balls is that your phone? Yeah No, emf.

It's might be em something else electromagnetic whatever Radiation I'm on board with this though. I hate like I don't know it's emf the studies I don't know exactly what it is, but like basically having your laptop on your lap and that heat is I don't know if it's radiation or what it is it like has proven to kill your sperm another thing like wearing whitey tidies You know like tight underwear where your balls are against your body that actually kills your sperm because it heats your body up too much Let them baby swing, you know, yeah The birds got a fly yes You keep them in the net So I've noticed that there's a few people in my life who I they're like the canary and the coal mine Like they they kind of get really into stuff and I'm when they first say I'm like, why are you even thinking about this? Why do you even care about this? You're you're one of these people by the way where it's like you Sam just got really into fucking mobility and like you know stretching He's like got really serious about like ripped dudes who want to stretch and be like super mobile or it'll be like, you know, um He's on this kick about like really wanting like toughness challenges like life is too good.

He's too soft So he's craving this like core primal challenge in his life Oh, is that just Sam being Sam? And actually what it ends up being is like Sam being ahead of the curve by like three years and it's gonna become It's gonna be proven to be like quite popular There's a few people in my life that I like them a brother in laws like this you're like this my trainer I've learned is one of these people where he'll say something and he's like, you know super into this thing I'm like, I've never like he'll be like, oh, yeah, dude.

I take cratum. It's like, oh, great. I'm like, what the fuck's cratum? Like, do you know what cratum is? No, it's like basically so he's big into like these like kind of supplements new tropics, which like, you know If the promise of them is amazing, but you like can't tell if they work or not like people who believe in them like, oh, this feels great But it's that thing we talked about before it's like the best product in the world is CBD for dogs Cuz yeah, it's the best you think you're giving them, you know pain relief but you'll never know if it does anything and like CBD for humans is like that too, but the dogs can't talk and And so there's a whole bunch of these like kind of new tropics or supplements.

That's like, oh, yeah I take lion's mane. I take like, you know fucking milk of magnesia. I don't know whatever They've been just a bunch of random ass names and then later like he said he was telling me about like Tonga Lee and then Dr. Huberman came on. He's like, yeah, I don't do testosterone anymore I do like I get it from these others like more natural herbs like Tonga Lee and whatever I was like, dude, there's only two people in my life that I've ever said this name Tonga Ali and like it's these two people And so I've just noticed he's ahead of the curve on a lot of these whether it's like fashion fitness supplements, new tropics, you know, like books that he's into and And so on the supplement side, he's like really this thing called cratum, which is kind of like a Advil Like you don't take it instead of you taking a set of Advil.

So it's like kind of like Helps with your aches and pains without the side effects of like thin your blood or your kidneys. Yeah, like you're bad for your liver shit like that. Yeah, and He's so anyways, I'm going with this. Okay, so he's like, oh, yeah, dude He's got his fashion line coming out where he's like making clothes basically just like I'm his only customer right now Cuz it's like not released, but I just get to have a bunch of his shit and I'm like, oh, this is amazing He's like, yeah, the shorts on these the pockets have like EMF protection And I was like what he's like, oh, yeah, like I'm big into like, you know, just why not why not have EMF protection? And I was like from like he's like, yeah, your phones in your pocket all days right next to your balls Like you just don't want that, you know, I want to have kids.

I don't want to have you having all this stuff there I'm like, I guess you're right. I guess I'm sick. That's like so normal. Everybody puts in the pockets of like Is there something to be worried about and I call this fud wear fud which stands for fear uncertainty and doubt So I do make that up. Yeah, there's a general trend I have creating here called fud wear and I think that fud wear is gonna be anything that's like. Oh, yeah, you know Like blue blocker glass like light glasses EMF radiation proof pants You know, it's like You know, like and that's not to say that they're all like it's not to say that any of this was false Like it might be totally true, but it's basically preying on people that are when you tell them Oh, did you know that paraben you should never have aluminum in your deodorant and they're like what aluminum am I gonna die? All right, I'm never using old spice.

I'll use native deodorant instead. It's like paraben free It's like what the fuck's a paraben but I I guess I've heard parabens are bad for you, you know Like that guy who came on the show and he was like, oh, yeah, I don't drink out of plastic because you know fallates I don't drink out of plastic either. Yeah, it's like it's still super common But the smart people I know are like starting to say this word fallate. I never heard this word before but I'm starting to hear this and it tells me There's a bunch of people that as they become aware they're gonna start to steer away or Teflon pans Right exactly like the nonstick or whatever Yeah, so I think there's just a whole class of products that are just fud wear and you can just find the next fud of like What are people afraid of it's like? Oh, like they want to do like UV cleaning of their phone and their toys because UV kills, you know, COVID and And you know, UV red lights a great one fud wear that's fantastic.

So a few more like the water filters So there's those charcoal silver water filters that are everywhere I think just Justin mayors said he tried to get a built like a huge one So all of his home water goes through this thing. Yeah, it's like intense. I asked Michael What do you do for water? He goes I go way over and I have like a 12 foot tall system that's filtering my wife Is it like a is it called like it's calling Berkeley or Berkeley? I don't know what it's called. But when Rob Dyrdek was on he said that too He's like I'm making a shower head filter company cuz like, oh, yeah What if I found out that I'm showering and fucking toxic chemicals? Well, then I'm gonna buy this attachment that purifies it like if you just put a little seed of doubt into my brain I'm gonna be like, yeah, why not? I'm just gonna get on the side of safety and on in the same realm with that and I actually I would have wanted to look into this But I think laptops on men laps is like a massive issue, right? If I like it could potentially be quite big just make a whole company just protecting men's balls From like the modern day, you know harm It's like yeah, here's a laptop tray.

That's like fucking made out of kryptonite. I was like you can't pass through this Here's your shorts. Put your pie and put it in this pocket. It won't won't fry your balls You know wear this underwear because you know your underwear has, you know cotton phosphors. What's a cotton? I don't know Shawn just made it up, but it's bad for your balls. And so it's like just good Sounded good, right? Dude, I'm telling you the heat it does freak me out like having that heat like I feel it And I'm like, oh, this is horrible for me So I have like a pad like you put a pad on my lap It's a small, you know pomade you need to apply to your balls every night before you sleep because you know that when you sleep The gravity pulls your balls and it's bad for you like how much makeup endless number of ball okay Here's this one that I saw these guys launch and they advertised with us early on it and I was like this is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of why are you guys even doing this and now it's a billion dollar company manscaped Have you heard about manscaped? I have I asked a buddy.

I said, what's one of the best investments in your portfolio? What are your best investments? I thought he's named some tech company some cybersecurity company goes Oh man scaped just great because they raised like only a tiny amount of money and they're worth like yeah like close to billion dollars Is it a billion dollar company you think I don't know something like that It's what they sponsored the UFC and that's a really expensive sponsorship and they sponsor a ton of stuff If you told me that they do like a hundred and fifty million in revenue.

I wouldn't be surprised I think it's definitely over a hundred million in revenue for you think it's over 200 And I've never used one I told I told Sarah to buy one for me because I won one for my nose hair And I think they have like why did Sarah have to buy for you? Why didn't you just buy it? Well, she wanted a Christmas present for I told my Christmas I was like give me like the nose hair one I think they have a nose hair one, but like I'll in one. Is it all in one? I don't mind using I would give you that cover they give you that air cover to be like Yeah, I just want to trim my beard and my nose and oh, what do you know? Is it all in one attachments? Maybe your boy will start manscaping.

Yeah, I'm cool Which are like using that on my face and I'm no the nose one's different But but the the manscape like buzzer it it's just a normal. I think it's just a normal buzzer I I don't know how it's actually different than like a normal hair much different and they crushed it this cat I never would a million years would have thought that this was gonna work It sounded like a joke when it came out I remember just being like oh, that's a funny that's a funny joke of a company cool cool joke of the day for a start Yes, and they kill it they sponsor all the major like boxing and UFC stuff.

These guys are killing it and it doesn't look so I'm on board with with with with the Protector balls. That's a good business and fud is a phenomenal name. What's it stand for fudware? Fud is fear uncertainty and doubt so they say this in the market a lot like if people are like Oh, I heard China's gonna ban Bitcoin or like is it it true that like, you know Satoshi was a you know part of the NSA. It's like this is just fud You're spreading to get people to be uncertain and doubt and sell their positions.

Dude. That's great like compression socks I buy compression saws that's fudware. I have no idea if it works, but it's supposed to do Compression socks when you run I have calf pain and Achilles pain all the time Compression socks are socks that you pull really high up to your knees and they have a lot of compression on it And it keeps your calf calves tight so you have your where like compression shorts like that tight underwear for your thighs It's like that for your calves and ankles Okay, I like it. I did it Can we wrap up with one thing? Yeah, so recently this Bitcoin thing Craig right.

I don't know much about it other than like one article I read I guess he's an Australian guy and he was being sued by this person who wanted a share of the money for What's the story? I don't know about his lawsuit, but I know about Craig Wright and that he basically for a long time has been claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto so well So he claims to be the creator of Bitcoin and then people who are smart in the community are like there's no fucking way So people but this lawsuit basically he's being sued by the spouse of someone this meant this Craig right had a partner the partner died and the spouse of the partner sued Craig Wright and Craig Wright won the lawsuit and in winning for what? She said that you owe me money because of this reason and that reason we created this you and my husband created this thing together you owe us some money and In winning I forget exactly how it worked, but in winning the case the jurors said well, no your Satoshi and you worked on this alone and so Like in order for him to win in a weird I don't know that exact details, but order for him to win.

They were basically saying yes We believe your Satoshi and Satoshi worked alone So okay, here's the here's the story so Kleinman versus Wright The jury ruled that David Kleinman's relationship to Craig Wright did not constitute a business partnership meaning the estate was not entitled to a share of the Satoshi Nakamoto Fortune which Wright claims to have control over as the self reported creator of Bitcoin the jury the jury ruled against Right on the conversion count awarding awarding a hundred million dollars to Kleinman what a Rule against right. Yeah, so so they got a hundred million out of it I don't know because I thought he was celebrating.

It was a little confusing But the point was is that this like This legal team, okay, they wanted billions they didn't get that but they got a hundred million against him for the unauthorized use of funds From Kleinman and Wright shared venture W and K info defense research LLC Oh, this is from something else. So did is this guy the guy who started it? That's so basically So he claims to have invented Bitcoin then There's a great clip by the way of Vitalik buterin the creator of Ethereum a co creator of Ethereum on stage and he goes There's they were talking about it and usually people like, you know, like in a in a conference panel people are usually pretty like You know, they don't take shots at people like live there and he just could be just pipes because you want to know what I think And they're like, yes, we'd love to know what you think he goes.

He goes He gives us like quick like two minute rant that just destroys Craig, right? Where he's like, I think if you're the creator of Bitcoin, you have a and everybody was saying you're not and you keep trying to tell people You are all you have to do is one simple thing You just have to sign something with with Satoshi's wallet and that will just show that you're him and the fact that you're not doing that Like, you know, he calls him like some like, you know, oxham razor oxham's razor or whatever like just some term like that He's like the simplest explanation here is that you're not Satoshi because if you have a simple way to prove your claim and you do not prove your claim using the simple way you cannot prove your claim and So you kind of just like shit on him right there.

So who crowd went wild? So who is this you think is he he's died or he's still quiet? um The best theory is that it's uh, that it's this guy hal. I forgot what his name is hal hal finney This was so hal finney was like a cryptographer. He received the first bitcoin transaction he was the like the second wallet and normally like What does the developer do when they test something that's like, oh, I sent it from like Sean a to Sean b like my test account basically like that's how I do the first transaction and He was like very active in the forums and then he died right around the time He got ALS and died around the time that the last known time that stochie ever posted anything Um, so, you know, it was like why wouldn't he tell? Do you think he Why wouldn't he like tell his wife or his family or you know, like Because it looks like he has a wife on these pictures.

Yeah. Well a maybe he did and b Um, like, you know, some people are so mission driven in their thing and they're thinking and like, you know, there's a there's a real genius of The idea of being like, I'm gonna have this as a Sedonymous name stochie Nakamoto not gonna use my real name. Which means I'll never get the credit for being a genius if this works But also it like it's kind of like the parent dies so the child can survive. It's like The only way a currency like this could have really worked is if you couldn't point to the creator Because then they would just attack the creator.

They would say the creator has too much. They'd say this guy has a Alter motives. He has controlled. He is he's too powerful to you know, he's just the new the new bad guy You know, okay, you're bad at the federal reserve and the governments. Uh Yeah, now you're bad at this guy for for a private citizen being in control of this. So you think this is him? I personally think it's him. Um, like I've looked into a couple times about like what who are the most likely candidates? You know, is it a group of people? Was it the government themselves? Was it one person and it does seem like it was Like, you know, I guess like I shouldn't say it does seem like it There's really no evidence of the existing evidence.

That's there. That's kind of like speculative data points. You have how Finney's fits the story in my worldview the best. So I think it's him. God, that's I love these mysteries I mean that it's it's sort of gone like his coins are locked up Unless he gave him to his wife unless he gave her the keys And like, you know and she and told her don't touch it because it hasn't moved not not a single coin has moved ever and You know, I think if he did it let's say he did give her instructions. How would I give instructions? I would say I would probably not actually let her have it.

I would say This file is going to be available to you on this date 20 years from now and I would say You know follow the instructions inside so I wouldn't even give her the opportunity to make a bad decision Because I would say if these move before Bitcoin wins Then it'll be this will be very destructive for it like if the creator of Bitcoin starts to sell Bitcoin That will trigger like a huge sell off in the market because it'll be like, oh the creators alive. They don't believe they're selling their coins Who is it? It'll create this like whole drama.

It'll hurt the project But has any money ever left his account? No, not a single Satoshi has ever left his account So then he would have had to have create a different account for her to live on or something. Yeah, which could have easily happened, right? You know at some point, but you know people can also see the ledger so they know who all Satoshi sent the they know which wallet Satoshi sent coins to And some of them are like known identities like the other people that were in this like crypto like the cypherpunk community that Wanted to test out the project early on But like you know, I think that's a good thing But like you know, he very easily could have just had her set up mining a mining rig So I didn't even have to come from his account He could just say it because he didn't give himself the coins he mined the coins Sure, it's just that mining was so easy at that time.

So you know, she could be miner number eight You know that mined some coins and that's it. That's she can live off that. Yeah See like, you know house finish what how she living is she like in a 40 million dollar home in Venice? I don't even know if he I mean there's a woman with all these pictures with him like it looks like a wife I don't even know anything about her. I just Google it doesn't say anything about the Wikipedia about his wife But oh yeah, his wife raised. Yeah, so he does have a wife.

Yeah, I'd be curious I'm looking at pictures of his house when he's dying like pictures of him dying and he's in his home It does not look fancy Yeah Yeah, also ALS just looks so brutal man. Yeah, it feels like the worst. It's really debilitated That's really tough. Yeah, so anyway, that's fascinating. We should do like an entire episode on that That's this shit is so interesting to me Yeah, I agree. We should we should just do the research of like, okay What is all the research that's out there and like what's the conclusion? I think people are I'm fascinated by like this story I think it's one of the coolest fucking out of straight out of a movie, but it's actually real life things that has ever happened I like that and Silk Road, but I think the Silk Road case is far more cut and dry than anyone things I think Ross did it.

I think Ross did everything Right You know, I'm what's the con what's the controversy people think what many people were running it dread Scott pirate whatever the What's the name dread pirates Roberts or whatever? they're saying that that was multiple people and Whenever I post about Ross olbright people are like free Ross and I'm like well like he did kind of hire people to kill What I'm not like other people like I don't know like what you have you seen the comments and you have a YouTube video about your story Yeah, they hate and they're like comments are like There's like an army of people that love Ross and hate they hate anybody that says anything bad.

You didn't even say anything bad I didn't say anything bad. I said I think he did it but like but like my thing is like Like I mean he's sold like he sold drugs So there's some consequence to that not life but some consequence, but if you did like murder for hire Yeah, life is is definitely fair if you at three times totally fair, right? And when like I read that a book American King pain I looked at some of the evidence that I'm like Yeah, there were some bad cops working on the case and those guys got in trouble, but it definitely seems like this guy did it I don't understand how there's any shadow of a doubt, right? By the way Fran Finney's Twitter bio and I'll just leave it on this note.

She says I graduated from Caltech I spent 35 amazing years married to Hal Finney Who lived with ALS from 2009 2014 currently living in Dubai. I vowed to spend the rest of my life making him proud I thought that was nice Yeah, man. She seems like a sweetheart and she turns out life. Yeah, it turns out It's like it happens to me drives like a Ferrari and a Bugatti and like only wears Gucci About us for the rest of my life these fresh ass Gucci's yeah Where's you see this you ever see that meme, you know that guy husband love a little like the little love him So he tweeted out this thing.

He goes man people say I had this like people always talk about my disability Do you see this meme? Yes, and what did they say? He goes? Yeah, I got disability to make that bread He's like this ability to make this money. I love that kid. He's not a kid. I think he's like 20 Yeah, I don't know what to say. I'm gonna get canceled. Just trying to like just try to Describe anything about him without being offensive. So I'm just not gonna say anything. All right, let's roll
