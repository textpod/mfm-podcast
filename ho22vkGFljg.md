Duration: 1 hours, 13 minutes, 5 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

So the background is this this guy named Kevin Van Trump. He is probably in his 50s late mid to late 50s And he basically I think he worked in Chicago on like the commodities like trading floor So he like traded commodities, but he's got a relatively thick southern accent, right? So he goes to the Chicago. He probably makes Eight figures trading commodities. So he like sounds like this country bumpkin farmer But like, you know, he's trading like corn futures and shit like that makes a lot of money Then maybe ten years ago He starts this daily newsletter where he writes the whole thing by himself every single day at this point like 17 years He's done that is it 17 years something like that.

It's like some almost 20 years. He's been doing this every day and It makes like something like in the world of 20 million dollars a year and subscription revenue Just to read it more now. I think it's like 30 40 million a year now So I've done calls with him and I'm just and this guy who's like, oh, hey check this song bitch out like that's a whole state Yeah, okay, so I haven't talked to you in like two weeks. You had coven you know, I had I Can't even explain what I had I would apologize because I missed so many recordings But in a way you gave me coven because I got coven because I went to this conference Which is you know a decision I made I didn't really honestly I wasn't really thinking about it coven's just been so present that I wasn't really like I Didn't do the math of like, you know if I go on a plane and I go to a conference of 2000 people What's gonna happen? And so sure enough I go to this conference as Sam hooks me up with he's like Sam's like hey This conference is amazing.

It's called farm con these guys. You've run it. There's super cool story You know, it's awesome And I was like, oh, I'm in and I was gonna go and I land and I'm like, yo, I'm here, baby Let's do this and Sam's like, oh, I didn't go dude. I don't want to get coven Well, I can't I canceled like last minute. I did like I thought that you knew that I canceled Because we had talked about you going and we had said I don't know we had not mentioned I'll see you there. Yeah, and I thought you knew I canceled So I felt horrible but like a week or two prior to That's like when Omni crumb and all this stuff happened and it's a it's a farmers conference in Kansas City My you know, I'm from Missouri and I was like, ooh, I think that uh, like that COVID will be there Yeah, I don't know if I was over it was for sure there.

It was you know, the main attendee the main keynote speaker Dude, we walked in so I walk in me Ben went with me and so We go in and me and Ben are literally the only two people in the room with a mask and there's like 2,000 people in there and I was like, ah shit. I didn't even really think about it and I was like, oh fuck It's here And I was like, well the odds of me getting there pretty high, but I'm now here So I gotta just make the most of it. So anyways, basically I go to this conference and everything that could happen to get COVID happened meaning like it's like Conferences in this ballroom great.

It's 2,000 people in one room. All right, that's not so good. They don't have masks on Okay, it's next thing that happened. I go to the gym in between like the sessions We were me and Ben want to get a workout in we go we meet this guy We're making small talk and we're like, oh you're here for the conference. He's like, no, I'm just quarantining here My girlfriend has COVID so I'm here I was like, oh, I just shook your hand and we what am I doing? And so then this guy my gym buddies got COVID I was like, oh great then I get on the plane finally to come back.

I'm like, all right I think I might have made it out unscathed. I don't know. I'm feeling okay Plane gets stuck on the runway for three hours someone on a plane in a closed tube with a bunch of other people for three hours I was like, all right, it's over. I got COVID and sure enough I get home and Two days later I get COVID that the dumb thing I didn't do was I didn't quarantine right away Which I should have just done I should have just said, hey, even if I'm not feeling anything I've been around a bunch of people I should just like leave but I was like Look, I just left my wife at home with the two babies for like, you know four days I should come back and help and in trying to help I ended up giving my wife COVID Then we gave both our babies COVID and so for the last 10 days, it's just been someone in my house has COVID at any given time And I've just been literally I haven't gone to a computer.

I haven't done anything I've just been get it taken care of it Ben did not get it. I think Ben had it like a month ago So he somehow came out unscathed it's silly get it He didn't go he didn't I'm going he flaked the night of And it was like actually like it's super inconvenient to get there after like change my flight has like a stopover fuck this I'm not going we'll do something else. So was it in you but you were even though you're vaccinated. You got sick I got pretty I got really sick.

Yeah, I got some really sick for three days. So let me tell you about my COVID experience I I got really sick for three days but it's just the flu with a side dose of paranoia because it's like oh, I think the flu this is this is COVID and so Definitely, you know fever all that good stuff whatever then the babies everybody had kind of the same thing But the bad thing is like I don't know how you are But I'm like a huge baby when I get sick me too and my wife is like, you know, never gets sick She's like one of those people just like never gets a cold never has a runny nose nothing And so even with COVID she was like she fought it off pretty good.

It was like pretty mild You know, she was still doing I think women are generally tougher particularly moms are tougher when it comes to that stuff Totally the hard part is when we both get the same thing and I go down like a you know bag of bricks and she's Yeah, she's just like what is this? Why are you why do you need so much sleep right now? I'm like I just can't explain in fact. I saw this meme that was so perfect. He goes is this guy He goes he goes, you know, it's so good that women have to give birth And go through labor because now they understand what happens when a man gets a cold And that's how it is I'm a huge baby about it and she like toughed it out no problem So that was kind of embarrassing did um so how many people how many full time employees work at your your company Uh, the the the DTC company maybe like 7 8 full time and and these in America Americans full time and you and you like are running me not all not all Americans but but you know people who this is their main job they work full time and when you not accounting the warehouse staff and Do you like do weekly meetings with them and run it like a company or is it really? It's run like Sean like very autonomous I've everything done via slack very autonomous everything done via slack We have one meeting a week that's in slack and I just say hey get in this channel right now But we just did it is that 10 30s like all right get in this channel right now And I just say all right you everybody here and then they just like emoji react and then I'm like cool This is like a real meeting meaning like don't go open ten other tabs like when I say something I want to response within like a second because it's like a live chat.

I was like but calls are annoying We all agree calls are annoying. So let's just like dude like just humor me. Let's try this meeting style. So we do it I kind of like it and basically I just say all right. What's everybody's main priority this week like what matters? Everyone's like oh, we got to do this this this I said then I'll be like that doesn't really sound that like that matters that much Can we punt that like yeah, I guess so and like we disagree on here's the three or four things that matter this week You're doing this you're doing this you're doing this and there's like cool I'll I tell one guy say hey check in on Wednesday And everybody just say how they're going on their things for the week and then check in on Friday It's a had how did we do for the week? That's it.

That's how much time does your wife spend on the company? It's a good amount of time like she's she you know She's a stay at home mom I guess like first job because like so during the day she doesn't really work on it too much just kind of like On her phone in between, you know, just like watching the baby But then at night she basically works from 10 p.m. When the babies are finally knocked out to To two or three a.m. Pretty much every night. She does that and she works on the business It does the designs and all that stuff So when you guys are both sick how bad like who's we did no work you just like you just have a Person who you trust and you say just handle it.

Yeah We're like, you know, just you do what you can do and then whatever doesn't get done doesn't get done But we're not gonna worry about it We're not gonna add a stress to our life that like says this week We also have to work is just impossible So let's talk about this conference for a second because I have been telling you about this guy for a long time And I think that you you humored me and the audience has humored me and they like oh that sounds neat But when you got to meet him, did you understand what I was saying dude? This guy is amazing this guy is amazing and what he's built is amazing.

So I want to go through I Have a bunch of thoughts, but let's start with with them Okay, so the conference called farm con and the families call the van trump family is that's their that's their name So it's Kevin van trump and Jordan van trump. That's like the two kind of like core principles. That's the father and son and I'm just gonna describe what happened when I got there because it wasn't like a normal conference so a couple unusual things I go in and There's a normal stage like a conference, you know, like they got that freaking wallpaper behind it That's like every sponsors logo on step and repeat banner.

Okay, cool. That everything's normal But the main speaker Kevin van trump is sitting not not in a chair He's got this like mahogany desk that was put onto the stage And he's sitting in it. He looks like a judge of a courtroom So he's got this humongous like oak wood Table that he's sitting behind in his thing and he's got a gavel literally and he's talking into the mic and he It's like a freeform agenda. So he'll be like Like he would just say something that he'd be like I walked in and he's like, you know, that's why I don't hire any Ivy Leaguers, you know Ivy Leaguers, here's the problem with Ivy Leaguers And he'll just go on a rant and there's like five panelists that are sitting there and then he'll just like do tell this story and the crowd Loves him.

I loved him. He is an amazing charismatic Speaker who is smart and very real and he's very he's just a very good speaker like his style was so Likeable I couldn't I can't explain the background is this this guy named Kevin van Trump This is all from memory. I met him four or five years ago at a conference and since then we kind of brought him into our circle of friends he is probably in his 50s late mid to late 50s and He basically I think he worked in Chicago on like the commodities like trading floor So he like traded commodities, but he's got a relatively thick southern accent Kansas City, Missouri Isn't really considered the South but it can be pretty country.

So I don't know where he's from so he goes to Chicago He probably makes Eight figures trading commodities So he like sounds like this country bumpkin farmer But like, you know, he's trading like corn futures and shit like that makes a lot of money Then maybe ten years ago. He starts this daily newsletter where he writes the whole thing by himself Every single day at this or like 17 years. He's done that is it 17 years something like that it's like some almost 20 years he's been doing this every day and It makes like something like in the world of 20 million dollars a year and subscription revenue Just to read you know, I think it's like 30 40 million a year now So I've done calls with him and I'm just and this guy who's like, oh, hey check this song bitch out Like that's what whole state He's like pointing at his new Picasso So I've done video calls with him and he's got like this like beautiful like chopper in the background like a fancy Customized motorcycle who goes oh, we just picked up this song bitch.

We just got this song bitch here today We really love the Picasso's and he like that's how he talks and he's he now his family Kevin or Jordan his younger son runs like this other business But in this the commodities world this like farming world They are gods and I've met a bunch of people who like them and they're like New York ish type folks who have like 50 $100 million and are like traders and they like revere him and they love him dude So so have you read any of his new sliders? They're so good.

Yeah, I must pay subscribers first They're like, you know, it's like it's like a 20 page PDF. So it's like not even like a short thing It's like a long thing and it's like he basically is writing about what he thinks is going on so In the market so he'll be like, you know Bean futures or you know rice or corn these different commodities He's talking about what's going on is really important for people in agriculture because if you're a farmer and you're making You're growing corn. You got to decide do I hold this corn and try to sell it myself do I need to take on some insurance in case the price of corn drops and should I sell up, you know, all of my corn, you know in these futures in this futures market or should I You know, should I hedge but should I take a hedged position against what I'm producing? And so you have to decide what you're gonna do with your crop That is your like for most people investing is this like side thing It's like you do your job that earns you your money your business energy your money and then you invest in the stock market Whatever they're two separated things for a farmer.

These are not separated. This is part of the like core thing Of what you do is basically managing your risk and these aren't guys that have like a farm that like they just like get by These are like folks that like supply the corn to like McDonald's and we're talking like they have turnover of 2050 like there years that yeah, he's like, you know, you'll meet the guy who makes all the rice for Chipotle He's like, whoa, that's crazy. That's crazy volume and then I would meet people who were like what you call gentlemen farmers They're basically people who don't need to farm.

They just grew up that way and they're like, yeah, my family I like living on a farm. I want my family to have a farm. I farm on my weekends and nights Like there's one guy. He's a CEO of a large company and He was just farming for fun, you know nights and weekends And that's why he was you know, like there and I was like such a bad use of like time But it's not it's a it's not a bad use time because it's a hobby. It's a pleasurable thing for him What this manual work is like how he relaxes how many were there? so it's about 1500 people and So let me explain this guy that their business.

Okay, so they have what I'll call three separate components maybe four Okay, so there's the newsletter the paid newsletter that basically you subscribe to you pay a thousand dollars a year And I think I believe I might guess based on some triangulation is that that's making about 30 to 40 million dollars a year now in annual subscription revenue and he's writing that you know, like we'd be hanging out It was like maybe midnight He's at the hotel bar or whatever we're hanging out and he's and I was like so Like, you know who on your team writes the letter.

He's like, he's like I wish, you know, I write the letter He's like I gotta go right up to my room right after this go write that some bitch and he's like, you know That's how he talks. Yeah, he's like, I don't know what the fuck I did this. He's like I created a job for myself He's like I told my kid my son I say you you need the best job in the world is investing You should invest don't do what I did I created a job for myself and I have to write this thing every day, but you know, you know, I love it Whatever and it's really ugly.

Have you seen it? It's like it's not mobile friendly It's just a PDF and it's like 3,000 words with like PowerPoint It's all substance over style. There's a few memes in there, which I like It's like, you know, just some here's some jokes And I think that's very on brain. It's good. The writing is great The writing is really great and the insights obviously matter Otherwise people wouldn't be paying for this thing, right? They're genuinely getting value and at the conference. He's a god, dude People people love this guy. They they respect his kind of like knowledge and his content And then they just really like him because again, he would say I wrote I literally wrote down verbatim things that he was saying Because I was like, this is just like this is so entertaining For example, I'm just gonna read you a couple of quotes on that he was saying So he's like I hate hiring Ivy Leaguers because they're too afraid of failure.

He's like, they don't well They done so well their whole life. They're not if they're not used to looking wrong or looking silly You know, go try NFTs. Go go go put your hands on the wheel. Go get go go fall go scrape your knee He's like, that's how I grew up. He's like my dad would take us in the car. He said no no seatbelts Maybe that's how we roll He's like, he's like, we're gonna take some risks when we get skinned up. We're gonna break some bones We're gonna fall off the bike. He's like, that's how you got to treat your kids Even if the smart kids you got to he's like because one of the big concerns is how do you get your kid? You're 60 maybe now and you got your farm your kids 30 They don't want to take over the farm or they don't maybe they want to but they don't know how to do anything with a saw He's like, you got a segment off a portion of the farm let him fail but let him have the skin in the game Um, he's like, you know, I want to have kids that don't melt down when the rug gets pulled I want to be able to go to them and say hey things things have changed and we're changing tonight And he's just like going on this rant and dude, I'm sitting there in the crowd and I'm like world star I'm like, this is this is such a hype monologue and had nothing to do with whatever they were talking about like being futures Five seconds before that but he would frequently go on these and every time I'm just nodding my head.

I'm like preach Um, like we I was at this dinner with them And people were like it was kind of like these guys that organize this dinner they're paying for but then they as you know Like sort of what's what's the what's the catch? It was we're gonna pitch our idea to kevin and a couple other guys Who we want to invest in it and they pitch their idea and he's like cool. So who's the uh, who's the who's the audience? Who's who's the customer for this? And uh, they're like, well, you know, uh, we've done extensive psychographic research here's a they slid over this thing He's like psychographic.

I don't know what that means man. What the fuck you saying? Who is the customer and they're like it's it's not demigrapes. He's like it's a psychographic profile up He's like no like name them. Do you know five people who want this product like would this guy want this product? Hey, you over there at the table. Would you want this product and the guy's like no, I wouldn't want it And the guys are like kevin you're not like being open minded He's like I'm trying to help you all he's like I've heard this idea 10 times and it failed I invested in this one it failed invest in this and why did it fail because there was no customer for this product And he's like trying to give him real talk and it was so good And the whole time I'm just like wow this guy's core business instincts Are very strong and his delivery method is fearless I just I I'm trying to do the impression because I want people to feel like what it felt like To hear this guy off the top of his head.

It's so different than corporate america It's so different than new york sf where everybody's hedging every word and packaging everything and trying to deliver it and trying to make these Fucking, you know, like criticism sandwiches where you say a positive thing than a negative thing than a positive thing to like You know deliver the blow whereas he would just say the thing And he did it in a way that came off great. I loved it What uh, all right, so you have a list of a bunch of shit that you've learned here Let's just rat them off.

I found them to be all wildly interesting Let's do a couple things. So the rest of his business. So he tells me so he goes I'm doing I know for sure his business was doing in the 25 million dollar range years ago, right? So that's so there's the newsletter component. Yeah, then he's like well, two employees by the way I think he's right and he's like, you know, I don't uh, there's never been a sponsor 15 years john deere comes to me. They say we would love to sponsor. No Trust for the odd he he had these principles He was like these people are gonna trust me because I'm not gonna be selling them to somebody and so He was like, you know, I'm gonna do it this way and I'm gonna stick to my guns And so and he's never done a never like run ads to advertise this thing It's all organic word of mouth one person sharing it with another saying you gotta Check this thing out forwarding it to somebody else saying hey You see what he's saying about where the market's going and then that person's like shit.

I need these insights and so That's an amazing, you know, that's probably 90 profit 95 profit like on that on that 30 million right? I think he uses I like what's talking about which email like it's so raw I think he uses sales force to send it out right like that's his email service provider like it's pretty raw So then the second piece of the business is I I think that there's now a secondary thing that's happened many many years in Which is like a big company will come to them and say, hey, you know, let's just I'm just gonna for for arguments like Chipotle's like, hey, we need um, we need somebody's gonna grow so Boy in this region.

So he's just like, hey, I know like, you know, everybody and so he's like cool Yeah, I can find you people who can produce what you need And they were like cool if we pay them let's call it five dollar five dollars a bushel You know, we'll make it five fifty and you keep your fifty cents as the as a broker fee So I think that now produces as much as the newsletter. So so let's double it basically let's tack that on um now the third thing Is investing so they basically had this, you know, they're like, well everybody keeps coming to pitch us ag tech They don't they don't know what the fuck they're talking about we know everybody in this space So they then started investing and I think they just had their biggest hit There's something called Benson Hill or Benson's Hill or something like that that went public um, so you know like the first kind of like public Unicorn that they seeded and the last one is the most interesting one of all this is what the sun is doing So do you know about this? Yeah ag swag.

So here's the backstory that he tells about this and I'm not sharing anything privately He told us on stage he goes uh met a guy Who he like moved into my neighborhood type of thing And he used to be you know big shot exec at some company and he's like cool. Like what are you doing now? He's like, oh, I'm uh I'm doing this kind of like either this buyout like leverage buyout or I'm going to become a CEO of This company called American Identity. We make t shirts and hats and he's like all right Kind of lame like sell t shirts now like you've done some big shit.

Why are you doing that? Few years later fast forward that company American Identity identity sells to staples for eight billion dollars And he looks at that. He's like what the hell he's a that t shirt company The hats custom hats like what what the what the fuck and he's basically like yeah, um, he's like who are your biggest customers? He was like, oh, yeah, my three biggest customers are Cargill adm and John Deere and he's like uniforms What's that? Is that are they making uniforms or they're just making licensed merchandise? So like I think it's like John John Deere.

They're just are printing it for the print They're making it for John Deere John Deere might have employee there They have you know 2000 employees they want to send John Deere hat or a vest with a green John Deere vest or whatever And so he's like those are your top. Those are your biggest accounts like those are my buddies Um, like I know all those guys and so after they sell it whatever is him and his son They create ag swag agricultural swag It's the same idea But now they go to all those accounts and they say hey you want like vests and and fleece and hats and whatever and you got You know 100 employees in your office in brazil you need to send some stuff too cool We got you and I think this is gonna be a really big business also And so they are doing very well.

He was saying they outgrew their their warehouse there They're trying to you know expand and all this He was telling me I want to say any of the numbers for that park He's telling me some of the just the square footage they need in the warehouse and I know From the ddc space. I know if you need that much square footage You are putting out pretty crazy volume. So Although that was amazing as well, but what an example of Just being a big fish in a and not even a really small pond right? It seems like a niche, but it's like Yeah, I think like you know aggregate like my parents are work in this industry And that's why I like this guys because I got to know him is like the thing that people like Guys like you and me and people listening this were these tech folks and we dismissed this But like literally everyone in america has an onion in their home or a product made of an onion Right and you you're gonna buy it multiple times a week Um, that's what my dad does my dad sells onions and I remember people I would make fun of him And he's like go look in your cabinet.

You have stuff that I have owned at one point. I bet and uh, and so it's not as small As we think I mean, obviously it's not like for example the the founder of square this guy jimmy kivley I want to talk about him too. He's this he was the keynote speaker. So he comes on the stage He was also a very good speaker I'm and I kind of have a high bar for that kind of thing, but he's he was very impressive And he gets on stage very first thing he says is Just want to say thank you to everybody in this room for feeding my family You know, it's like but it just it's like such an obvious thing But I say yeah, of course where all the shit we eat comes from somewhere and in my mind is going to sound super dumb and Ignorant, but it's true.

Which is like Before this conference, I really spent zero percent of my time thinking about where the heck the food comes Where heck food comes and if you thought of a farmer you probably had stupid stereotypes of like dumb idiots for sure I was like, oh and in going into this I was like, oh, I'm gonna go meet a bunch of hillbilly like rednecks Basically was my and they do talk like that. I'm from there They they definitely will talk like that, but they like are wearing like a $50,000 Rolex and when I get there They're like, you know, yeah, you know put options on bean futures and you know with brazil coming on board You know, I'm gonna I'm gonna take this hedged position against corn and I was like, oh wait yall are like Fucking wall street traders wait what and I was like, okay Maybe it's just a couple of these guys and I was like and then I would meet guys in the hallway And I'd be like, what do you do? Oh, we have my own family always owned a farm in South Dakota for 40 years Okay, cool.

So I was like, do you do this like kind of like fucking soy soybean oil futures? And they're like, yeah, you got to I was like, how do you know? He's like, well, we got a broker but like, you know It's key to the business. You gotta you gotta be doing it and I was like, holy shit Like you guys are more sophisticated financially than anybody. I know like I could go to in silica valley I could go to talk to engineers or or angel investors vcs And I could be like, hey explain to me how a derivatives contract works or explain to me how a how the corn futures market looks Nobody would know what the fuck they're talking about.

Nobody would know what to say dude now now Okay, so you've you've not made fun of me But you tease me a little bit about like loving trucks and farmers now. Do you understand why I think it's so cool Like these guys are sophisticated and everything but like the people you and I hang out with in our in our coastal Coastal cities, they don't give a fuck about these folks and I'm like, man if you Gotta make those collide and be awesome, right? And so a couple a couple things like on that note. So when I was at one of the dinners They were talking about uh, it was the who's the customer dinner They were they're talking about something they and something came up.

They go, uh, you know, how long he's like how long we've been here about Whole foods and uh, you know plant based this and oat milk that He's like this still tiny fringe shit. He goes America eats corn bread and milk at scale This is what America wants. They need how much how much volume is the whole food and then I'm thinking dude in my bubble Everybody eats like that. Everybody eats the fringe shit So it was just awareness of like two things one is like in the future Maybe what we're doing ends up becoming more mainstream.

I do believe that But how not it is is crazy the scale The difference in scale of just like, you know, corn versus, you know, the the non whole foods versus whole foods Is like to them whole foods was this rounding error. I thought that was hilarious because to me it's like, you know It's like, I don't know where I shop every day. It's it's the main thing and again, all this is gonna sound really like Dumb, but uh, I'm dumb. That's I guess the answer when I was there. I was learning how dumb I was about everything Um, there was so many different things like that that I was learning.

Can I just rattle off a couple other things? Okay, so Jonathan write us in the chat. Is this is this I could talk about this all day. I think this is the coolest shit ever So I'm gonna give you a couple of pain points and or business ideas that I Saw or heard when I was there or just making up because like, oh, maybe this um, so one thing is Even though I'm like, oh, these guys are really sophisticated There's no way that they want to be that sophisticated about this all these like kind of financial Products that they have to use for hedging their the props they produced and the insurance and all that good stuff So I think that some kind of wealth front type of Robo advisor that basically just does all the work for them to manage their risk is Is gonna be like important because every single one of them is like, yeah We have a broker we call and we talk to him and he tells us xyz And he tells us what he what he thinks we should be doing and we come up with a position we want to take and then we take it So that to me set felt very old and I feel like if somebody does a real advisor thing, that's interesting Kevin van trump had an idea he goes I want to make a rally road and I think we've talked about rally road on here Which is basically rally road is like this app you open up and you can buy a fraction of Cool memorabilia, so it'd be like a sweet old car or first edition harry potter signed book set It's awesome.

It's in my opinion rally road has one of the best apps. I've seen in like the last two or three years super nice app Hopefully I wish I invested in honestly I feel like I've been saying that for a year Probably should have just done it at this point, but really cool product really cool app So he was saying he's like I feel like he's like I think we could do rally road just for our stuff And I was like, what do you mean? He's like, you know, just like the the original You know motorcycle from dukes and hazards or you know, and again, I'm all the references flew over my head He said them really fast, but like it was basically just cool hick shit And um, and I was like, oh that's probably actually a really good idea because these guys got money And they care about this stuff and there's like a network effect of just speaking to that audience Dude, didn't I tell you um, so, you know how I used to work for the show american pickers Do you do I don't you were not in the market for that because you were in uh Were you in Australia at the time whatever but you if if the show was around now you wouldn't watch that you don't fit that That bill but do you know that that show american so for those listening I used to work for the show american pickers and it's basically like pawn stars.

We'd go out what did you do for them? So the main guy in the show his name is mike wolf. He's the main character He owned this store and it was called pickin and so you go and you just knock on doors and you go to barns And you find old memorabilia and you either sell it in your own stores or you sell it to antique shops Or you sell it on ebay and like the antique shops. They have to get it from somewhere. They get it from pickers This guy like would buy old bike bicycles That's a big market or he would buy like a old 1936 harley for 10 grand and sell it for 30 grand That type of stuff and he owned the store and he started filming himself Pre youtube for like five years to make the show popular pitching it to the history channel year after year after year getting declined Finally, they said all right.

This is cool. He's a good looking guy charismatic guy They pick up the show. He gets he was not rich off the pickin stuff, but he was like making a living gets rich because he Um licenses the show he owned. He's the producer. He owned all the rights I work at the store where we would sell the stuff that he bought the his picks, but So many people would come to the store that basically we sold 30 grand a day of t shirts and shot glasses And because he was like eventually he wouldn't even sell the picks anymore because he was like I need I need stuff for people to look at when they're in the store and he probably made I mean his business was probably doing 30 40 million dollars a year off all of his whole all of his stuff And when the show was on when the show was live it's still live now, but it's past his heyday when it was live We were the second or third most popular show on tv On all of tv and we would have people flying from all over the world just to come and look at the stuff that I mean I would I helped run the store But like half the time I was just holding the door and making sure that we weren't at capacity And um the reason I'm bringing this up is this whole rally road for middle america shit This is the real stuff and like buying like these rare baseball cars or whatever it is That's the fringe and rally road has built a great business on top of that Exactly and by the way if you were going to start this I would I had email sam and cc me just so I didn't get to know but b I would go to these guys like Mike Wolf I would go find these kind of like all american influencers And I would use them to help promote the app and help get them all get them on board to to grow this thing And I think this is kind of like You go where nobody else is fishing.

I think there's just not much competition to build technology products in that space I'm gonna tell you a couple other ideas that were that were in there. So Any kind of fintech for farmers so part of it's like this wealth front idea But also just like I've invested in six companies that are all just variations of like, you know brex or mercury bank So basically like So there's two startups that got big that were in the that were serving Entrepreneur serving tech startups one is mercury, which is just saying hey instead of going and using bank of america or wells fargo Just use mercury as your bank, right? We have a slick interface.

It's a mobile app. You never got to talk to a bank or You know free wire transfer, but it's not really a bank It's um, they're partnering with another bank and they just layer their branding on top of that bank. They're on top exactly Um, but they've done really well. They're now valued over a billion dollars. You know, this guy who built it mod He's kind of in our in our friends group. He's awesome. And um, you know, he's great. He came on the pod so, uh, you know, so so mercury is bank for tech startups and then brex was Visa for tech startups and same thing not, you know, they're built on top of the visa rails or the mastercard rails or whatever But it's just a credit card for startups and it was taken advantage of the hey, we understand startups.

So like for example You might be a startup that's raised 10 million dollars of venture capital But your credit card limit is five thousand dollars because the banks like did you have no income? No history, no nothing no credit like, you know, we can't give you money and there's like, dude I just raised 10 million dollars. I have the money in the bank like in this big They won't cap points on ad ad spend because they know that startups spend most of their money on ad spend Exactly or things like, um, you know, just the fact like hey, you can fill out the application online You don't have to talk to human and it'll be like sent to you in two days or like, you know You want this to like easily autofill online? Like there's due little stuff that it makes it like work well for that audience mercury for farmers on board Brex became a multi billion dollar thing mercury did and I've been I've now invested in versions of either mercury or brex for teenagers for teens in india for business in india for canadiens Creators is the one that everyone for creators.

I do that one creators make this for food creators This it would be it'd be so much better to do this Yeah, it'd be yeah, it's gonna be created. That's what we call farmers. That's what we call farmers We're gonna rebrand farming is the creator economy. They're just creating food. Yeah. Yeah seed creators Um, dude, it's so much that would be such a better company And they're spending a lot of money right because like the all of it the equipment the like, you know, this the The fertilizers these are like huge bulk purchases my cousins.

I have an aunt and cousin who it's a mom and son They have 1500 acres with like a thousand cattle or so and I've gone out and hung out with them And so they basically raise bowls to It's called bucking bowls like at a rodeo the bowl that is like it's called that that bowl is bucking And at a rodeo the guy the cowboy who stays on wins money and the bowl that bucks the hardest wins money And you can also make money by if you have a really good bucking bowl You get money by getting its semen out there and all the females they kill and turn into beef And they make a living doing this.

They're I don't they're probably millionaires But uh, they are fucking hard workers and when they walk around places like during a work day because like when you're a farmer You're constantly driving to get feed whatever they'll have 20 g's on them in cash Wow, like they just have just like fat loads like you just need Or like when they go to the rodeo rappers and farmers, dude When dude when they go to the rodeo, I've seen them They have like a they've had like 10 grand on them because they got to like buy this while they're there They gotta do this they gotta make their bet anyway These farmers have fuck loads of cash because they they're still doing stuff with cash.

So like This is an interesting great market. Yeah With the other one if uh automation So I think the the number one thing that was on everybody's mind is automation How do we how do we get more automation? So I think from the beginning technology has helped farms which is like, you know Before there was tractors everything was like, you know horse pulled, you know or whatever and then tractors come out It becomes a big deal and john deers trying to do self driving tractors and Everybody's trying to do automation and so I think if you're sitting at mit Or you're a Carnegie Mellon and you're in some robotics lab And you're like, okay, I can keep making like, you know Things that I understand that from you know, there's a gadget that like turns off my light switch in my room Because I don't like to get up once I lay down.

Yeah, so that's what I'm gonna do. It's like dude instead Go to a farm for like three weeks And just watch what's going on and then from there come up with the automations and stuff you want to pull I've invested in a few companies in that space. Um, so it's automations and precision agriculture. They call it So, um, right, which I think automation falls under precision agriculture. That's like the the term I believe and uh, It's incredibly interesting. So like you talk about like automated car or autonomous cars Autonomous tractors is incredibly intriguing. Right. There's also like sensors So just like soil quality is like the soil health is like one of the most important things if your soil health is bad your crop is fucked and so Just being able to come up with models where you can go put sensors in the ground And get real time soil health data Um and alert people hey this plot in this area is not going to grow very well because of this That also seemed like a big deal.

So those were some ideas the last one is family succession planning. So One of the biggest things was like, how do you pass down your farm? Um, because if your kids don't want to do it and increasingly, you know, kids don't want to do it Um, what the heck are you going to do with this farm? Uh, and so there's like places that you can sell farms. So I think that was one opportunity There's creating your estate your will and all that stuff. There's renting it out to other people. There was just a whole bunch of stuff around Okay, if billions of dollars of farms is going to trade hands in the next like 10 10 years Who's going to be in the middle of that? And I think working with remember one we had one episode where we talked about picking your customer And we were talking about this company user voice or user testing.

Which one does your mom work for user testing? And I was like, I think that's so cool because it gives people like your mom like moms who raise kids I don't can't have full time jobs. It gives them work. That's admirable. That's exciting. That's incredibly motivating I think you could I would easily put farmers in that same situation Um, or in that same category where it would be really exciting and fun to work with those guys, right, right? totally Uh, there was a couple startups that I liked one was called acre trader So these guys now they've raised like 60 million bucks.

I think peter teal invested in them and basically it's just fractional A land ownership of farms. So the idea is you can buy I could go on there today and I could put down a thousand dollars And buy a piece of a farm in north dakota And I can make eight to 11 percent a year On that thing and I could diversify I could own pieces of five farms in five different states I do five different things and then there's a farmer on the farm that does the work That's leasing the farm from you. You're just owning the land and these guys I think the average farm that they were doing was like two million dollars in size Uh, and they did like 80 farms last year or something like that.

So I was like, okay That's actually pretty good Like they buy they basically buy the land and then Fractionally sell it off and then they take a broker fee plus they take a like management fee of 0.75 Percent a year on top of that just to manage the the just to be the property manager of the land So it sounds like this conference is badass. You you it changed your perspective on some stuff for sure. In fact, I actually just want to say Uh Conferences in general. I think that the general rap is conferences waste of time You'll see that a lot on twitter, especially from smart people people say that I give the exact opposite for you.

I think conferences are pure fucking alpha Meaning I think there's so much gains to be had at conferences number one you leave your routine and that's just Freeze the mind to just like get out of the like get yourself out of the weeds and get somewhere else Then when you meet somebody at a conference There's like just meeting people in person like it's so it's so crazy. You don't have to do anything You know that I met Kevin I spoke at a conference and I was just hanging out the lobby and Kevin van trump came up to me And he was wearing cowboy boots and a Ramones t shirt And I thought that he was like a weirdo like I did think that he was legit, but he was like Talking like a big game not like bragging but kind of like he told me his business and he had I could he had like a hundred thousand Dollar watch on and I was like wait you're telling me he's like yeah, I got 20,000 subscribers I was like oh sake you guys make money through ads.

He goes. Oh no paid subscription. I was like wait who are you? So I uh, he remembered you he gave a great intro when he was introducing me He's like I met this guy sam He used to work for american pickers and vote and he just gave he told the whole conference about you and how great you were It was awesome And so anyway, I met Kevin at a conference which now you've been brought into the fold This is going to influence you in some capacity. You're going to bring other people into the fold That's why conferences are cool conferences cool.

Secondly go to weird conference So if you just keep going to the same insular if you like I actually think that going to conferences that are not your industry is Something that nobody really does and I've always done like I went to I remember like a restaurant trade show conference and I've been to a gym Equipment gym owners conference and I've been to and when you go you just meet a whole bunch of people from a different totally different walk of life You see, what are they thinking about? What are they? What are their? What are the problems these guys are worried about? Who are and you you know, I'm sure out of this.

I'll get some investors for my fund. I'll get some new ideas I'll get I'll get some new perspective And you just makes you a more interesting person and so I would highly recommend going to trade shows specifically but like um, it just different industry niches that are not yours And just go go to a sneaker conference and just be like, oh, what the hell are these sneaker heads doing like who are these people? What do they do? I know it's like a luxury if you if you have the time but If you work remotely anyways go to one of these things spend four hours on the floor and then spend the other five hours or whatever at night You know working and just work from there for the week Um, or if you're young and you don't know what to do don't just take a job Like go dabble go travel around to three of these and you'll just have like a totally different lens of things So so I think that's like a hack.

Um That's you know, I wanted to bring up Uh, yeah, it's crazy. By the way, these guys the farmers the best thing I got from them was their little one liners like They were one guy was telling the story about this investment. He lost a bunch of money on and people were like Damn, you like that like holy shit. He must have lost a lot. He goes It was a sad day, but you know, that's why Johnny Walker makes a blue And you know, you just like move on. I was just like I'm writing these down like these are bars, dude These guys are these guys are amazing Can we um, are we allowed to talk about? I think so why not? All right, let's talk about so do you want to give the bat? We might want to bleep out his name So let's let's bleep out his name.

Just well, let's talk about this Well, let's let we'll ask him after this but all right, we um He there's this guy named. I didn't really know much about him Somehow I got brought into this group chat that you're in in a weird way I feel like I'm good friends with him now even though we've only texted. Yeah, he uh, uh How does he talk about what happened over the weekend about this app? Okay, so um, So basically here's his short story. He's built a couple of like products. Honestly never really had a big hit Um, him and his friends have been working on and they were working on a startup or they're working as a startup for a number of years They were just grinding running test after test and they were really building a lot of stuff in the social space So he learned a lot of like kind of the like cut his teeth in trying to build the next twitter next tick tock next whatever, right? and They were about to fail the last thing they built the hail mary was they were like, oh, let's just create this like kind of like quiz app This like superlatives app where it's like.

Oh, who at your high school is most likely to you know become a professional dancer or like, you know get go to jail or whatever and It goes viral and it's called tbh And it goes viral it hits like number one in the app store because this the flow is basically you You open the app you start answering these questions about your friends They would text your friends being like hey, Sean said you're most likely to x click here to see what else he said Oh, dude, I'm gonna click that and then you click that and then it would go on something something along those lines So tbh goes viral facebook ends up buying it Smart move by kind of knew this thing doesn't have like, you know legs to actually be the next social app But it made them like, you know a good not like I don't think it's sold for what it was reported Yes, it's like a hundred million dollars.

I think but it made you know a lifetime of money Yeah, exactly. So these guys they pull it off in the end, right? So they went from like literally they were about to shut it down. He's like, ah, fuck it. Let's just launch this last thing and um and that thing hits so Then he goes to facebook. He stays there for like fucking for full four years. So he hits the full vest and he's he the whole time I don't know he's probably bored and he's just on twitter and he's like He's what people call shit posting which is basically like, you know, just posting jokes on twitter And oftentimes making fun of the tech industry so making fun of the stuff that people in the tech industry are doing and um So anyways, you know people like to follow him because he's funny So over the weekend.

So he he basically he tweeted something out last week that was like Hey, I'm working on I'm gonna work on a new project. I finally like left for facebook or whatever Um, I'm working on a new project. I'm gonna work with a designer If like I'm looking for a founding designer if you want to like, you know, build something amazing work with a team That's built, you know built apps blah blah blah You know DM me something along those and when he quit and announced that he was quitting at facebook It said I've been at facebook.

They bought my app. I've been there for four years Um, it really was just um, there was a lot happened and I want to give a thread on everything that I learned And and and it pointed down down like the down emoji and there was no other threat. That was nothing there. Yeah It was hilarious. Here's what I learned my four years at facebook nothing Um, and so yeah, that was hilarious. And so people were like, oh people people generally are excited about next to you thing Especially all the kind of like venture investors and angel investors This is kind of the entrepreneur you like to back which is somebody who you think is smart who? Um is a serial entrepreneur so not their first rodeo, but also hasn't had the big win So they still have a huge chip on their shoulder and want to want to make it big So that's like a great entrepreneur to invest in and he's pretty well networked and pretty well respected So people want to invest in it So he tweets that thing out looking for a designer and then somebody else said uh, somebody two days later just tweets like I saw uh, you know a mock up of a new app like holy shit It's gonna like change everything and this guy's also is like a shit poster this guy, uh, I think it's handles like another cohen or something like that And um, and by the way, you've seen the the image that he's talking about He's posted in our text thread before but like, you know, here's an idea like I might make this thing And if I remember correctly, it wasn't even like it's not a business.

It's like it's like a it's just like a silly idea And it's like high level ideas. So he's still ideating. He doesn't exactly. Yeah So anyways people then start memeing that guy. They're like, I just saw a new app A new app for the first time and you know, this work that I've had on my toe for years Just went away and like, you know, the next person would be like, you know I showed it to eight children who were starving and now they're you know, they're not hungry anymore so this goes viral as a As like a meme on twitter.

I'm gonna read you some of them that were there the good ones. They're great. They were great Let's see. Um There was guys saying like we're happy to announce that it was Andrew Chen We're happy to announce that we just led And uh, a hundred million dollar round into a new app, right? I can't believe they're extending Um, I just got to a session with my therapist. She ended to ask me for tips on how to get allocation into new company and So just became this like meme in the tech industry and then a lot of people were seeing it like, what's this app? And so and by the way, this this idea this like kind of like what quote unquote growth hack it was accidental A but b really effective and it drummed up a bunch of interest in a bunch of hype around What this new app could be and so what he did was he created an nft with like, uh, I think he saw 69 He's got oh my god He's got this really stupid like image for his twitter picture, but it's kind of like funny Uh, and he made different twitter images based off of his and 69 of them And if you bought one you get early access as a beta user to his app, right? I don't know.

Was that the promise I didn't know that's the promise look at the floor price of what those are So he goes ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce the Hino shit posting club a collection of 69 Owners will get access to quote app parentheses. There is no app. It is now available on NfT And so he links it and it sells out As as nfts do and I think he made what did he make off this thing? All right. Oh the floor has dropped So anybody who bought this I think is probably not doing so hot Um, the floor is now only 0.36.

So that's not great. But anyway, it's still a thousand dollars. So 69 pictures for a thousand dollars Okay, not bad So here's what I want to ask you I mean, I want to ask you a question because you have done something similar I didn't know before you and I you introduced me to him. Um, I knew him as like a guy who built an app but It seems like people revere him like they considered him an expert on consumer apps um Which not saying that he isn't he certainly is is pretty successful. It seems but also what the fuck But but also like his reputation like is so big where it's like is anyone that good? That's kind of what I'm gonna get and You've done a good job of that as well of creating this like mystique Uh, almost out of nothing, right? Not that like you weren't successful ahead of time But like you've done a really good job of building a brand call it what I sold my startup for less Than what my investors have put in now.

You know the way it worked, you know The team still did well and I made good money off of it But like that's not that's the that's not the definition of a successful business Because there's a lot of people that have sold their companies for a lot of money We have a we have a handful of buddies that are like uber rich No one fucking knows who they are and like even if they told you that what they did you'd have to like they'd have to beg Just be get a conference whereas guys like you you've got like the daily show reaching out to you You've got celebrities reaching out to you who want to like get on board with you and then And then it's in the same thing because you can make it sound good.

I could say I sold my sold my last startup to amazon Yeah, technically I did technically I made money, but oh that's not it. That doesn't make it a Like a huge success. You know, it doesn't make me like a thought leader I don't think that's the right way to say it because that you you're acting like you're tricking people because you have never tricked Anyone ever and I don't think as either but what you've done is you you've both done this really good job of creating a little bit of mystique About and what I want to know is you can use the example and then you how does someone I guess I'm asking for myself because How do you create so much of this like brand equity? Like you guys have I think in both cases it's basically you put out you put your thoughts on blast So, you know, there's a real the real answer.

And by the way, I say that not to make fun of the I think it did sell for a profit. So good good for them. I'm saying I know that I've gotten disproportionate credit for my track record of success When in reality like the best thing I've built is this D2C company that I don't tell anybody the name of That's the profitable business that's doing eight fingers a year. But like that's not actually why people My reputation came before that. So, you know, that's kind of weird, right? So where does the reputation actually come from? It comes from two things one is you meet people in real life.

So like you go meet you know, the investors at these different big funds or CEOs of different companies And when they're talking to you, they're making an independent assessment of your love your caliber You're based on your thoughts, right? So so first it's like a hand to hand combat thing You meet a bunch of people you earn their respect one on one by By, you know, when they're talking about some deal they're doing or a company they're building you You actually contribute by adding value by pointing out things or or giving them criticism or or giving them feedback on what's really great Um or identifying to them other things that are really cool and they say wow this guy really, you know I got a lot out of this conversation So you do that with like 300 people and those people matter, right? Because they have themselves influence and trust.

So for example um you know, uh Like josh elmond is a good example This guy was he was early on at linkedin at facebook at twitter at robin hood Uh like early ashawn meaning he was he was like head of growth at a bunch of these companies. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah He's a big deal. He's been on our podcast and so he's got you know People have a tremendous amount of respect for him because he's had a tremendous career Well, both and I have you know and separate occasions met you know met met with josh And we when we're talking about our startup and whether our startup succeeded or failed josh knows look You're playing in the sort of like the startup lottery startup olympics a startup can fail and an entrepreneur can still be really great and If out of that conversation josh josh walks away thinking oh, this person's really smart And then they connect you to some other people that they they know and and those people say wow josh Thanks for the intro.

Sean was really great You develop a reputation amongst people who have a reputation. So that's the first step Through real life interactions. You develop a reputation with people who already have a reputation So that they will retweet your stuff so that they will vouch for you when you have a project or you're doing something And that that goes a long way in the marketplace So like for example, I've had josh or biology or different people who have Their own big following and their own respect if they share me or they they they say this person's great Then a whole bunch of other people just inherit that reputation.

They just say okay, if josh says he's great He's great. If josh says he's great. He's great. It's such a unique way of it's almost like Credibility hacking or something like that. But but that's the thing I think is important is like I'm telling you how the mechanic works, but there's the thing you can't just the reason it's not a hack is because Your your thoughts actually have to be interesting. You have to actually hack like you're you're a hack I just mean like you're you're Though getting the desired the the process of getting to the desired outcome, right? The second thing is we both created content.

So now Tweets are mostly making fun of people who create content and threads and teach courses But before that he was doing it himself, right? He was he himself was saying, you know, when you're building a social app blah blah blah or here's how we grew inside high schools for tbh and Why did I respect him because he released this this memo actually got leaked from inside facebook? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, and the memo basically said he was like hey guys at facebook Here's some of the stuff we did to grow amongst teenagers and I know facebook wants to grow amongst teens Here's some of stuff we did at tbh for example for every high school we would create an instagram account for Branded to the high schools would be like, you know, mckinley high Uh, you know secrets and that's the instagram account and it would be locked And we would follow anybody who had mckinley high in their profile Then they would follow it, you know 40 of people would follow us back They would request to follow but we were private.

We wouldn't approve anybody's request Then at 4 p.m. When everybody got out of school one day, we would accept all the requests So everybody simultaneously would get a notification about our account So they would all go check it out and then they would all see the linked download the app And then they would download the app and then and then as they were downloading the app They'd be getting notifications that their friends are all downloading the app today And it felt like a big deal and that's how we hacked distribution into high school I similarly have told actually a very similar story about how we would go get Our goal was always to get half of a high school to download our app in one day We did it a completely different way, but I've shared that on podcasts different places or on twitter threads And people read that and they're like, oh fuck this guy's smart.

That's a really smart growth tactic This guy really understands growth. This guy really understands teens. This guy really understands social And if you just if I like is that quote my buddy Jason Hitchcock told me once he goes You say one interesting thing. I say, huh, that's interesting. You say two interesting things. I say, huh, those are interesting You say three interesting things. I say fuck this guy's interesting And uh, that's really what you got to do with content is you have to if you say three three original interesting things around one topic whether it's bitcoin or media or Robotics or whatever if I get three interesting things from you I'll in my brain.

I will assign that tag to you. This guy's interesting worth watching And then if other people endorse it and say this is interesting it goes even faster Dude, this is this is exciting to me. I think this is a fire episode. I'm not gonna I don't want to talk about it entirely right now because I think we should wrap here but I So last weekend you when you were sick. So you probably didn't see this I tweeted out about sdr's so short term rental stuff Did you happen to see that I saw it and I followed what you were talking about looks super interesting your facebook group I want to hear more about that So save it for another rep if you will save it, but did you join the group? I didn't join the group.

No, I didn't know the name. It's called sam's sdr's or something Yeah, I just made it in the car like my sarah was driving and I just made it in the car Such a smart way to do things by the way like it's gonna sound super simple Like I just made this thing because you were curious and wanted to learn about it right like you hadn't decided to do it Yeah, but it's well. I have now, but I'm still looking for property though, but I um Sam's sdr crew. Yeah, I'll let you in and there's like a thousand or 1500 people It's mostly all tech guys dude.

I've met some guys. Did you get these people you tweeted it out just the tweet That's it only that It's all tech guys like it's that guy a j Who owns that the the peck? Yeah business and then it's Nathan Barry. It's marshal haas I there's there's guys in there that I've met guys that are like billionaires like who have sold or rather They've sold companies for a billion dollars. I met one guy who's making half a million a month in profit He's paying himself six million dollars a year off of his a handful of Yeah, there's another guy in there who owns 50 million dollars worth of them.

It's crazy I'm learning all this in this fucking group. It's amazing. So you're gonna have to browse through that and I'll tell you some more We'll start with that one next time. Is that interest to you? Dude, of course it's yeah, that's great. It's crazy Who would have thought about about short term rentals and how they're crushing it hits the highest level of interesting me Which is where you say what am I doing with my life? Why don't I do that? All right, you raise your quote question your own life is the highest form of interest the thing is The thing is is that like you you don't need to quote be doing it You just need to have done it and there is a world where you not quite set it and forget it But like you just like it's not like you need to do shit all the time to it Right and so I would say like one of the criticisms not a criticism But the one of my feedback for Sean and how Sean should like evolve maybe is to Sometimes invest in some of these a little bit more boring stable things at least just a tiny portion of your of your money And like this is like a really interesting asset class.

Have I told you about steady? No, this is sweet. I think you'll like it. So I I actually I think the website is cool steady I want to say it's steady dot capital or steady capital dot com one second. Let me pull it up If I just type in steady, okay, do steady dot capital steady. Why how do most? Okay, tell me what just tell me what you see it said it's a black screen And it says how do most millionaires build their wealth 90% of millionaires invest in real estate steady lets you earn passive income from real estate for $100, okay? And then you invest in Okay, so steady is a web dashboard for retail investors to buy shares of income generating commercial real estate commercial real estate make investments and senior financial reports in our dashboard and get monthly deposits from your investments directly to your bank account We do not offer high adrenaline.

This is the part I wanted to create. Yeah, we do not offer high. This is this is really good copy We do not offer high adrenaline investments. We don't have an app designed to keep your eyes glued to your phone We pursue steady returns over hype. We are the tortoise in a race full of hairs. So good. Wonderful. So good So I so I read this so this guy I used to play pick up basketball with her He was on my like interreal basketball team. He this guy Dylan. He created this company I just kind of saw his twitter and I was like, oh, what's that guy dealing up to like And I didn't even know he's a startup guy like he's just some dude we used to play ball with And um, I was like steady capital.

What's that? And I read this landing page. I was like, dude, what is this? I got to invest literally so I invested in both his company as well as I started putting my money into steady This is why you invested in steady. Yeah, because I was like do this this this is what I want I was like, I want to own I want to have real estate income coming in But I don't want to do the work of like going and finding a property Diligencing it underwriting it taking out a loan for myself buying the property managing the property all that good stuff So what these guys do is They basically handpick Sponsors so they'll have like Guys who have a good track record in commercial real estate commercial So they'll be like, oh this guy buys warehouses in the middle of Texas And they basically diligence the properties for you and then all you do so what I do I just had auto invest so it's a I just say $5,000 a month just as a starting price Like I'm gonna have a five grand a month into commercial real estate cool over the this year I'll have 60 grand put into this and then it just shows me it's like cool You're gonna be you're gonna break even in 18 months, but you're gonna get your first check next month and The you know that basically what they do is they go to that sponsor.

They say hey You know, you're gonna raise money for this deal anyways. Give us half a million bucks. We have this Cadre of investors. We come in as one line item on your thing and we become an investor and then you just Like we our investors want passive income through real estate investing and he's like he's trying to do like the Robin Hood model where it's like Robin Hood made it where there's no fee. You could invest for a very small amount of money So it's like normally real estate has pretty high barriers to entry for knowledge as well as the amount of money you have to put in So his mission is like I want to make real estate as you know, investible for real estate As you know investible for even a hundred dollar and even a hundred dollars if you're earning eight percent Great, you'll earn eight dollars of passive income.

Is this gonna be big? You think it looks cool I think it's a really hard business to do because you know, you have to it's like a two sided market You have to have really, you know quality deals But honestly like these aren't like Like for example with startup investing I don't just give my money to anybody for startup investing because I'm like, dude, are your deals any good or they all dog Shit with real estate. It's like these are like the property. There's so much data about the property It's collateralized by the property the the guys got a track record You're not looking for the next uber the thousand X return you're looking for something that's going to generate eight to 10 percent a year eight to 15 percent a year and Cool, like that's doable.

That's not that doesn't take a miracle. So I really like steady I think there's currently a wait list or whatever people have to like, dude, I just signed up for it It looks sick. Oh, yeah, I'll email the guy to get you in if people want to do it. They should they should do it I think is really I think is really good for people. Uh, like I've had I've had multiple people asked to invest in my startup fund And I just say no I'm like if you're not already wealthy, don't do this because this don't use this as the way to get wealthy You have much smarter paths to get there if you already have if you're already, you know Multi millionaire cool.

I you should do this then to get some exposure to startups But I think for most people getting exposure to passive income real estate is a much better Place to to build wealth if you're not already wealthy through your business or what? It is the this is a good episode I'm I'm interested in steady. I have a whole bunch of other topics still so I'll save those for Wednesday I appreciate you holding down the fort while I was uh, it was hard It was hard I think like I had to do it with Ben and Ben's great and but I had then I did it with noa and noa is great but you and I are I mean, you're talented which I talk about all the time you and I together are talented and it was very hard with It was way harder without it was work I love to hear it.

I love to be needed It was work dude. It was work and like I thought there's been times where I'm like, oh fuck I could just I could handle this It was work It was like I felt like I was working by the way if people haven't listened to the episode you do with ben on the silk road It's on our feed. It's a special. I think it's called special episode silk road. I don't know what it's called Go listen to that. I listened to that while I was sick. I fucking loved it Because I've been meaning to read American kingpin for so long.

You told me it was so good and I'm just like back to I was not reading it and uh So listening to that gave me my fix and it it's like, you know, the best kind of Netflix shows where After it's done You then go down the rabbit hole and research more for like an hour on your phone in the middle of the night under the covers Like that's what I was doing about so dude, dude that one. I think we've prepared for 45 minutes It wasn't a lot but we were both so fascinated by that topic and I think you Something happened where you weren't able to come and we found last minute and we're like, let's just do this Ben and so we're going to do another one on Uh, a guy called Matt.

I forget that there's another version. There's another like juicy one But uh, I just bought the book. I'm gonna go read it and like do it That's those episodes were fun and Ben's really good at that stuff Yeah, exactly. And you guys play off each other really well the one thing I really wanted to know Because while you're here, I'll get you How did they catch him? So you you had said like basically they traced his uh, you said, okay He had he he had originally posted on this forum saying, uh, yeah Hey, has anybody seen this thing and then also that, um That they caught him in the library right down the street from you.

So I got those bits, but I wanted to know Yeah, how they know it was him Yeah, and um, yeah, like I think there was a bunch of details about like the investigation like that the cop chase basically Uh, yeah, so basically was there more there? You know, it's so funny There's this episode of cell park where they're trying to like track this terrorist and the boys are like, dude Just like do a reverse google search and like like just use google and that's what they did and so the very first post ever about The silk road was written from a username and that same username posted a few weeks prior to stack overflow Saying i'm building a website that is trying to do this Yeah, can you please email me ross olbright at gmail.com?

And then they like did they like used a web archive because once they once he once ross caught his air He changed his username from like all toyed to like frosty or something like that But it was on the web where like he was asking He used a username to post about i've created a website or no, sorry He created a username it says has anyone heard about this new thing called silk road and that was the first time anyone ever mentioned it But just weeks prior that same username asked about like how to build an exchange or something like that And then they found out who this ross guy was and then they realized that um Oh, we just like went to this guy's house recently as holand security because he ordered like 18 ids with his picture But for like different states with different names.

Let's keep an eye on him and they found out basically was like All right, whenever and so they had a fake fb. They had an fbi guy become an employee of the silk road And ross or dredg pirate roberts the owner would say like all right. I got a log off to go blank They noticed that ross would walk out of his house and go for a walk Right like they just tracked them or they're like, all right I got to go to dominican republic to do blank and they're like, oh ross is in dominican republic on vacation according to his facebook Right, and so they knew the the fbi the day he was arrested He got arrested in the library right down the street from my house in glenn park And they said basically the fbi was do not arrest them.

We got to get a swat team and they're like dog He's on his computer right now. We're chatting with him and they like tackled him right like logged in this second We know we're having a conversation with them. And so they had two fbi agents he was sitting at a chair in the science of this library that he used to go to he was sitting at a desk in a chair and They go they had two fbi agents dresses kind of homeless people Go right behind him and get into a fight where the guy was like, bitch What are you doing here? And the lady was like, fuck you man? You don't know like, you know, like they got like a domestic disturbance And so he turns his back and when he turns his back the other fbi agents one tackles him and the other one Swipes his computer from his desk and runs it straight to the van and they plug it They already had the they knew that he was using a pc They had the outlet right there They turned the video camera on and they start filming them.

They go look here's the fucking He's on the dashboard right now as we speak. Here's us We were literally just talking to him and then they plug a usb in and they like they get a lot of the stuff out Before the computer goes to sleep and is locked and so that's how is there no movie? Like I know there's like a kind of a shitty movie. Why isn't there an amazing movie about this? There needs to be it's such a good story The the book american kingpin is the best book I've read in years and years It is such a fascinating story and it's also as we said in the podcast It's incredibly challenging story for someone like me because this guy ross looks like me right like when you hear about Gangsters and shit.

They're usually like poor oftentimes minorities and like well, that's like the other that person's not You know, I don't I don't relate to that person Ross was from a good family a white guy a good looking dude who lived in san francisco played on computers Had these ideals of like I want to help the world and you're like, oh, he's just like me But he's a fucking criminal who tried to like supposedly Wanted to kill people and sold more drugs than al Capone and so it makes you question like what's right and what's wrong Yeah, dude, it's so good go listen to that episode if you if you like that a little bit But it was really good.

So that that definitely got me through one of the one of the covet fever nights I mean, I'm in I got my fever going. I'm listening to the silk road. I got all kinds of crazy ideas in my head It was awesome. All right. That's the episode. Oh, um, we have to do one thing before we before we go so we um Two or three weeks Four weeks ago at this point We did a contest on tiktok where we were going to give $5,000 to at least one Person who created videos about using our youtube videos and chopped them up and posted them on whatever platform and used our clips So the end result on tiktok alone Our hashtags and like the first two weeks got something like 30 million views.

Do you know that? Damn Um, and we're giving Jonathan confirm in the chat. Are we giving it to to the people that I think it's the cartoon Let me know but the first guy that we're yeah, okay And it's the the first guy we're giving it to his name on tiktok. I believe was mfm minis I think his name is Michael and he posted a bunch of videos a few of them got more than a million views His name cuts, right? I'm sorry Oh, yeah, I can't get that wrong because there was an mfm minis as well Jonathan tell me exactly who the winner is in the chat.

I can't get that wrong Mfm cuts is the winner and this person got something like so mfm cuts. That's the winner mfm cuts That's the winner this person got like 30,000 followers on their tiktok channel and like 10 or 15 days millions of views They won and then the second place person who also gets $5,000. I think they're called Tune pods is that what they're called? Say it again pod tune mr. Pod tune so they turn podcasts into cartoons like south park style We've retweeted a couple of them because they're awesome and they are hilarious.

They are really good So the best one was where I was making fun of you for not wearing a shirt hilarious really good I have a feeling both of these guys are going to end up making a lot of money by Turning this into a business and I bet they already have Yeah, exactly. Um, good job. Good job by them By the way, mfm cuts the guy he is in university still want to I email them. He's 19 I love it. Uh, good job by them And I am so can is this still going can people still like win next month a different like a different person could win? Or no, yeah, we're gonna keep doing it.

We gotta wait I gotta wait till Jonathan tells me we're allowed to announce it But we are going to continue doing it because we saw uh in december our podcast basically in november We were like just shy of a million in december We basically skipped over a million and went straight to two million And I think that that tick tock thing was one of the reasons why it happened one of a couple reasons Yeah, and did we do this other winner to the 60 minute thing? We'll announce that next time. Okay, sounds good Uh, all right, I gotta go good stuff.

Good to you again. All right. I'll talk to you in good episode
