# MFM #159: A 9-Figure Sex Toy Company & The Man With A Million Acres

Date: 03/10/2021

Duration: 1 hours, 5 minutes, 49 seconds

Model: Whisper-small

I don't think I would want to do something that high profile because if you screw up, it would be a big deal. Oh, look at you. You're afraid to fail now. Oh, you make it big. You sell your company and now you're like, I gotta watch my step. What's going on? I'm not afraid to Where's the guy with the pirate ship tattooed on his thigh? What would that guy do? Sean's in the studio. Are you in a garage? Is that what that is? I am in my garage. We uh We upgraded we improvised so we did this crazy thing where we had talked about on the podcast.

We were like, shit, we need to like upgrade our setup. I think mostly was you just telling me to get a haircut, which is fair. And wear a shirt. Wear a shirt and uh, I took that as I need a whole new studio. So so basically these guys who are um from Chicago, they're like 23 year old guys who love the podcast. They were like, they heard that. And this is like their forte. They do like camera, audio. They have their own podcast. They have their own YouTube channels. They're basically what I realized was I went and watched their YouTube channel and his YouTube channel has like this guy Henry, his YouTube channel has like, I don't know, 570 subscribers.

So it's not like some big YouTube channel. But if you watch it, it's the same level of quality of like video, audio and editing as like Casey Neistat's channel. And I showed this to our friend, Sully, and I had a video of him. And I was like, Casey Neistat's channel. And I showed this to our friend, Sully, and I go, I go check these guys out. Like, look at, look at their channel. These are the guys coming this weekend to make my studio. And he goes, he goes, I remember when I was kind of like 21, 22, we were coming up.

And what the kind of 30 and 40 year olds used to say was, oh man, you guys have this huge advantage because you're like, you're like digital natives is what they were calling us. Like we grew up with a computer and the internet. Like, I think we got the internet and computers when we were like in sixth grade, I don't know about you. It was probably around the same 56 grade, something like that. And so, you know, for our parents, they were getting a computer when they were 35 or 40. So it's just like, you know, you didn't have that you didn't have it to grow up on.

And so he goes, these guys, this is the next the next wave. They're video native. Basically, they grew up with a camera in their hand and they just like constantly shoot videos. They know how to edit it. They're not afraid to be on camera. And like, it's such a superpower. And I think it was so true what he was saying. You said one line that I think is the real superpower, which is being on camera. So for you and I, we're kind of like media people. So we're maybe a little bit more used to it than the average Joe.

But even I am still very uncomfortable just talking to a camera and like looking at it. Young people are not when I was at the airport, I saw 12 year old kids with like the phone on the ground with a pop socket. And they were like, and I could see that they were doing TikTok dances. And it was like, that's like unheard of for me because I'm like, oh my God, you're going to do that at the airport with people watching. Right. Right. Yeah. The upside is they're all look cool. They know how to dance and they know how to edit videos.

The downside is like, you know, they're like riddled with anxiety and stuff like that. So, you know, it's not all it's not all good. And they're not having sex, which is a topic we're going to talk about. We're going to talk about that. But the other thing I was going to say is, let me ask you this. When you get as you're on Snapchat, right? You have Snapchat? I had no, I have an account. All right. So, all right, I'll bring you a brain. You got a time in here. How old are you? 27. All right.

So you're more like us than like the people I'm talking about that are kind of like, I'm not going to say Gen Z. Yeah, but God, I think those, I think those couple, he is a lot hipper. He's a lot hipper than we are. All right. So a little bit more into it. Okay. So, so basically, or bring you when you have Snapchat, right? So someone sends you a snap, right? They send you a picture of something they're doing something they're looking at. And you need to reply. Tell me, do you just type the reply in the text version or do you send back a photo? That's so weird.

Yeah, see, that's crazy to me. That is wild to me. I'm like, you say something I comment like it's fucking like it's Facebook, right? I just write like, Oh, looks fun. Cool. That's great. You know, like I'm like a 90 year old. You're talking about young people. Another interesting thing to do is when you ask a young person, or did you show me this when you ask a younger person? What it what do you do when someone calls if they put their hand for the people listening? I have my hand like I'm waving high like high five and they put their hand like a high five to the ear versus they put their pinky and thumb out like this.

Well, or if you say, Hey, do like a gesture to take a picture. So if I said to you, Hey, Sam, take a picture. Yeah, you're going to do this. What the hell is this camera? Yeah, this is not a camera. Right. So so so what they do is they hold up their hand like this with their thumb, like you're holding an iPhone, right? We're like out here with a Polaroid trying to trying to demonstrate what a picture is. Anyway, so I don't even know why I'm talking about that. But basically, these guys are, you know, I would say younger people are video native.

And I think that's going to be a huge, huge win for them, because people like us are like self conscious and like just don't know how to use the tools. Right. I want to bring up a topic that's both related to this and something else. So at Sean's old office at Monkey Inferno, the guy who owns it, Michael Birch, awesome. It looked like it was out of a magazine, but he had one or two things that really stuck out. And one of them was this Macintosh computer was a Mac Mac Mac to is that was called to Apple to Apple to so I'm going to look that up.

So the reason I'm bringing this up is I am building my studio to look good like yours. And I was looking thinking of like designs and interesting stuff to put in the back. And I also this all NFT has got me interested in our and like, you know, just like Yeah, just like valuable or not valuable beautiful interesting cool stuff. I've always liked stuff. Just like junk right. That's what I used to like. But now I'm going to try to get some nice or shit anyway, I was looking around. How much do you think so isn't Apple to is that Apple to the same as a Mac is a Macintosh to I don't know.

Well, wow, how much you think an Apple to that still works costs. I don't know a couple thousand I'd say maybe some routine two and five it would be my guess two and 5000. You can get one that's in pretty good condition for like $500. You can get one you can get a Mac Macintosh to which I don't know the difference between the Apple to the Macintosh to you can get a Macintosh to that is still in the box for like a grand. And do you remember the commercials when we were younger we were in our teens we were probably in eighth grade or ninth grade, where it was like a colored Mac.

So it was like a blue it was called the iMac I think right. You can get those for like $300. Now, strictly speaking like from like a collectible like just it's interesting it's it's cool to look at that's incredibly cheap for a machine that I tell you what every single person who came to our office was like, Oh, this is awesome. I'm now granted is tech nerds coming to the office but they were like wowed by this thing. And there was like expensive art all up on the walls. Nobody cared about any of that. People saw this old thing and then we would boot it up and they would turn on and they were like amazed by it so it definitely every single person noted commented on it.

I think these types of like old computers these vintage computers. I think these are going to get really popular and the reason I think that is I was looking up how much. So for a gift, I thought about buying people an iPod that wasn't connected to the internet. Did I tell you this? No. So I was going to buy people like our investors I was going to buy them like a small thank you I was like maybe if I spent $200 ahead let's see if I can go and buy a bunch of if I can buy like 20 iPods that aren't connected to the internet.

And my plan was ruined because I'm like oh wait you have to have itunes itunes and that doesn't even exist so like this is pretty much meaningless but these old iPods. And tunes exist. Well, but I mean like you know, I'm buys it. Can you even buy MP3s anymore from it? I don't think so. Yeah, you have to like have your own music. Yeah, like that no one does that anymore you we all stream and like these things didn't even have internet. I wanted it so you could like download it and then it would only work if you were attached to Wi Fi.

But anyway, old iPods, like old old ones first generation ones are expensive like $500 $600. And so anyway, I think that both would be cool to have this stuff on your dude if an old iPod is $5600 and Apple to in the box or Mac to in the box is also $500. Yeah, I definitely know which one I think has more more like long term value here. Those those those things are collectibles I think you're you're spot on I would scoop up five to 10 of those right now and just hold them. Yeah, I'm okay.

So like here's a vintage working in good condition. Macintosh to for $250. I'm looking at it on eBay right now. Here's a Macintosh in the box for 400 bucks. It's pretty interesting right I think this might become pretty popular these old computers and I think that it's kind of a cool idea. I like that a lot. Those are good and I actually will go after this on eBay and try to scoop up at least at least two of those just to hold and see what happens. All right, you want to get into. You have two updates and then we have an idea to ideas.

Yeah, okay so one update is on the Michael Jordan thing so last episode we talked about Michael Jordan's house has been on sale for 10 years. It's a 56,000 square foot house, and it was originally listed for $30 million. Now it's been price cut price cut price cut all the way down to 13 million, and it's still not selling. And this is after the last dance it's after this giant boom and like trading card collectibles like the Michael Jordan rookie card is going for almost $2 million and his 56,000 square foot house can't sell for 13 like something seems off like a little tiny three inch piece of cardboard can sell but not this.

So, and he's paying property taxes I think somebody somebody said he's paid about a million dollars in property tax, just while it's sat on the market. And so we threw this out there last time we said hey look, why don't we either collect just me a new or we crowd fund. Why don't we buy MJ's house and like what could we do with it, and we got a bunch of good feedback so I would say like, there's a bunch of smart people who immediately pointed out that one of our ideas which was to turn it into some kind of museum the museum of Mike, you know the basketball museum, wouldn't work because you know the HOA the neighbors would never permit you to let like 10s of thousands of people come into the neighborhood and and go to this museum every year right so that's I thought about, I mean, I was thinking about I just figured there.

I mean, I'd be a way around something. Exactly, exactly. When you start an idea you don't think about all the different like small reasons why it might immediately fail you think you know what if this works and then you find try to find a way to make it work. But the more interesting one, in my opinion was always the simpler one which was, you don't have to turn it into a museum, you don't have to get permitting, you don't have to have guests coming in and operations folks. Treat it differently you don't treat it like a house, you treat it like it's a monument it's a piece of art.

And there are paintings that sell for $885 million. And so if a painting itself for $85 million I think Michael Jordan's house this relic of the greatest basketball player of all time is going to be worth something and so the idea would be your crowdfunded it you get out of 5,000 people to each pitch in to grand. You buy the thing out for 10 million bucks. And you hold it as a piece of art. And then you know what I there was a couple of good suggestions I thought came in through Twitter so some of the good suggestions were.

You could list this on rally road, where people go to buy like you know vintage cars or rare first edition Lord of the Rings book sets for $35,000 that you, you know, 500 people each buy it a fractional share of it. And that was one idea people liked and the rally road guys said hey we're interested let's talk. So talking to them they they they hollered at you. They did they've applied to the tweet and then Rob the I think he's the CEO co founder. He emailed me yesterday and so we're gonna we're gonna chat and see why does everyone cool reach out to you.

Bro they know they know. Damn, and I didn't get anyone hollered at me. Well, are you are your DMs open on Twitter. Yeah, I'm open. Yes, I've also talked to him before through DMs because I was just like rally's fucking awesome so I had reached out to him actually saying hey rally is awesome can I invest in this thing. So he knew I was a fan boy already. But anyway so that was one interesting thing. Some people in the crypto world were like dude let's turn this into an NFT bro. And so talk to the founder of Nifty Gateway, which is just exploding this marketplace that's just exploding for NFTs right now so I asked him hey, would you like to dabble.

And then the last thing was that some people were like hey and what do they say. He was like hey this is cool, but he was like you know we're just crushing so hard on the digital stuff. I don't know if we want to get into this physical thing. Because there were some cool ideas from the from Twitter some people were like, you know let's say you came in and you bought a $50,000 chunk. So you instead of the $2,000 entry, you go for 50k. And that should get you like if you present your your certificate of ownership here if you show your app and you show that you're you own a piece of this thing.

You should be able to have like a three night stay once a year with you and all your friends. We're going to share MJ's house. Exactly so so you're not fully doing an Airbnb you're treating it like it's art, but if you own a big enough share if you're you know a super minority owner of this thing, then you can actually stay one weekend a year and I thought that was pretty dope. Cool ideas, but then at the same time, I ain't got time to do this and either to you so what's going to happen from here.

You're asking me I don't know I feel like you're kind of the leader on this one. Nothing. If I had a bet nothing I hear and here's why when I did my deal. Every smart person I talked to what did you know what they said I bet you can guess what they said. No, no, what did they do nothing for six months. Right. Yeah, yeah, don't invest. And so many times I've been I wanted to change and do something and everyone has said the same thing and I'm going to try my hardest to stick to it.

So that's one of the reasons why although that's probably a bullshit excuse. The reality is it's kind of an I don't think I would want to do something that high profile because if you screw up it would be a big deal. Oh, look at you you're afraid to fail now you make it big you sell your company and now now you're like I gotta watch my step what's going on. Where's the guy with the pirate ship tattooed on his thigh what would that guy do dude my first time buying like a real estate asset and doing something like this would be like I mean that would be national I mean I guess yeah I'm not saying you buy it I'm saying clearly the way to go here is to crowdfund this thing because it's just more fun that way and you don't have to put out $10 million of risk capital.

How many emails did you get. So somebody okay that was the other thing so somebody created a website Jonathan created a website I think it's like by by Jordan's house calm or something like that. And I think he said you know pretty early on after the tweet he said he had 200 people dropping their email. And I think about the same on Twitter said I'm in, including a bunch of higher profile people there's a bunch of people who are a bunch of really wealthy people founders of companies, owners of owners of businesses that were like I'm in for 5k I'm in for 10k type of thing.

Now, are they just talking is this real I don't know we'll see but I think it was cool I mean the little video that we had reached 100,000 people I think across a couple different platforms it so it was cool and what we decided the takeaway from this is we got to do viral clips all the time we got to we got to be like Obama the club is the best place to find lover. Exactly. It's not even a conversation this is now just a collection of clips. Yes, and the clip the clip had 60,000 views to your Twitter clip of you talking about it.

Really. Yeah. Well, the shitty part is that it's you talking about it and me looking at just like it kept showing my face and you're talking the whole time and I'm just dude. That's the way the world goes you put the white man's face up there. The brown guys just in the back, coming up with ideas and handing them over. That's why they get our voices confused because they say I look like a bro but I talk like a nerd and you look like a nerve but talk like a bro. That was the most spot on I wasn't even I was like I'm not mad at all that is so accurate and you know I mixed now I understand why people keep saying this thing that they get us confused and make it it now.

Let's talk about sex. You have something on here, and you, before we get into it, I want to tell you a fun fact so we have this list where Sean and I list ideas he has one thing and it says, why aren't young people having sex and what are the opportunities here and apparently 31% of men 18 and 24 were sexually inactive before. Yes, inactive. And the tweet was from a guy named Matt Allison. Who does a bunch of cool stuff the tweets not there anymore. For some reason, or at least I can't see it.

I canceled probably can't say you can't say man anymore. So this guy Nat is really interesting his names Matt Allison. Google him he's got like a cool website he owns this agency business. Did you know that this guy, so he's interested in this because he owns this thing called like, I'll have to look up what's called but it's a kegel app do you know what a kegel is. I do know what a kegel is. Okay, like exercise you do with your private parts. Yeah, so basically it, it makes it so you don't premature ejaculate and I think women do it to you know I don't know like.

I think women do it because it like it can increase like the pleasure, but also I think it's just healthy for you to do like it's just like a, it's just like a movement that's good for you I guess I don't know. And this guy his name is Elias and not Elias and he has an app called I'll look it up what it's called, but it should be called squeeze, because to do it to do a kegel you're basically trying to like, you know for a guy you're basically trying to like flex your balls. That's the best way I could describe it.

And for a girl I'm sure there's you know the equivalent, but I don't know what is it called. It's called stamp stamina, stamina. I don't know what that play on words is anyway, it walks you through how to do these kegel exercises and it makes like 100k a year, he just made it one time and it just ranks. What it's a crazy interesting thing kegel exercise I never I never knew that was a thing. Go ahead. Okay, so, so we've talked about this before and before when we said, I think you actually were the original person to kind of rant about this you were like, dude, kids aren't having sex you're like I went to this.

You know, people make funny for the hot dog stand thing they're like we get it you used to on a hot dog stand. The other story that I've heard you tell number of times because very entertaining and I think it gets you hyped up is you went to some camp, and they had a bunch of had like a Gen Z, like you went to some summit, and they had a Gen Z analyst there. And the Gen Z analyst was like, hey, all the kids are depressed and not having sex. And you were like, dude, what's going on.

And you talked about replica, which was this app messaging app where you message like a virtual girlfriend. And I tried it out you've tried it out. After you told me about I went downloaded it. And it was okay it was interesting. There's definitely a bunch of people who are really into this. It's like this AI virtual girlfriend. But I have a different slant to it that I want to bring up here. So, and by the way, this whole sexing this has been a problem in Japan I think for years. Right, right. Yeah, it was like, you know, the sexless generation or something they call it like.

Okay, so I want to actually talk about a company that's based in Austin, right where you're right where you are you might be able to see it if you look out the window. It's called interactive life forms LLC you know these guys. Yeah, I know where they're building is I've seen their building. Do you know what they make. No, interactive. Do they make sex styles. They make interactive life forms this is the maker of the flesh light. So, I wanted to tell you about this so I did a little research I got a message from a founder of a tech company.

I won't say his name because he said no. He said don't say his name but he messaged me and he goes dude idea. Modern flesh lights. I was like what he goes flesh lights and he breaks he broke it down for me he goes. The sex toy market is bigger than you think. So, female sex toys like a dildo or vibrator are on the rise and there's this big like kind of like anti like people trying to remove the stigma around it. I don't know if you've seen any of this but it's like kind of the feminist movement.

They call it they call it sex positivity which basically like hey sex doesn't need to be taboo it doesn't need to be stigma. So, you know, you have sex that doesn't make you like you know a bad person or something like that. And so there's a sex positivity movement and with that has been this big boom in sales of sex toys primarily female sex toys. So, I started looking at the most popular male sex toy which is the flesh light and so here's some information about the flesh light. I'm joined by this guy Steve Shubin, and this guy super interesting he basically he's a he's one of 13 kids.

He goes he plays college football then he goes into the army then he comes back and he's a police officer with the SWAT team in LA. And he like retires from SWAT when he's like 30 something because he's like, I love being in the police force but it doesn't pay well so I'm going to start a business, and his wife is a pro tennis player. So he's got this hot tennis player wife, and he's like I'm going to start a business he doesn't know what he's going to start. And by the way, do you know who that hot wife and Steve Shubin's son is.

No, who. Aubrey Marcus the founder of on it. Oh no way. Yeah, and he co founder Joe Rogan. Yes, because flesh light was Joe Rogan's first sponsor that Aubrey secured. That's amazing. Okay, so I'll get into that that's actually a part of this so. So, so years go by he does nothing. Then they're in their 40s. Steve's wife gets pregnant, and the doctor tells him hey you're in your 40s so this is kind of like an at risk pregnancy. So you can't. You can't be having sex. And he's like okay doc like you know what do you want me to do I'm a 63 red blooded American what am I supposed to do.

And so he starts thinking about it. And he goes, Why isn't there a, why isn't there a sex toy for men. And so he originally plans to make a mannequin and in fact in 1998 he gets a patent for a mannequin with sexual application so it's basically like a doll that he wants to make. So he's trying to make this doll, and he puts in 50k, and he starts working on this doll and he's, he's trying to blend all these different polymers how do you get this skin feel of this doll, how do you get the flesh to feel like flesh how do you get it to look like a doll feel like a human.

And, and he makes a family business so he brings his sons into the to the table, they get a whiteboard out and they start brainstorming together as a family which I find hilarious, because you know, in my family this is not a, this is not a business we can start together. So he keeps going two years go by he's put into a quarter million dollars now he sold zero, zero, zero products so far. And he keeps trying to make this full body doll. And he meets a guy one day, a friend of his and his friends like hey, I think what you're doing is great.

There's this weird taboo around this, but why not more pleasure in the world what's the problem. So he says, Will you give me one I'll buy one off you. And he says cool what your address I'll send you the doll and he's like no dude no way I can't bring that doll into my house. He's like just take out the part that's like the vagina of the doll and send me that like put it in a little box and I'm like my wife won't see it and just send me that. And so he's like dude if my friend who wants this won't like can't buy this doll this doll is dead.

So that's why he pivoted from the doll to just the just the like you know just the the organ part of it just a single piece one component. And he's like okay how do we brand this so him and his sons are brainstorming and they're like, what do guys like guys like tools. Okay this thing's kind of like a flashlight. Okay we'll call this the flesh light. So that's how it gets its name during that process. And so he eventually was like a father son project father son project multiple weird man. Now years have gone by, they put in over $2 million.

And this guy believes so much in this thing he ramps up production he's pumping out 1200 units a day before they've sold anything because he's like, the world is going to love this they are going to buy this thing. And so he goes all in on this to meet this you know future demand and turns out they actually did it so the flesh light now. These guys do I believe about $100 million in revenue. It's definitely above 50 it's they don't report it but it to me I did some slew thing and I think it's $100 million your company over 100 employees.

They basically dominate the market for for male sex toys now. And you know this guy who went all in on this thing, it ended up being a successful family business, which I think is, you know just a heartwarming story. What a crazy story and I had heard a little bit about it but I didn't realize. I didn't know all those details, but I by the way, this is the best part of the whole story. So he opens up a facility in Austin so he's manufactured near you. Then he has a one in Spain, and he has one somewhere else in Asia I think, and he has so much like, like manufacturing capacity.

So what do they do with the excess capacity when they when they have a little extra. Yes, what they make, they make prosthetics for elephants who have had their legs blown off in the, you know, from where there's mines in Southeast Asia. So they're the top maker of elephant prosthetics in Southeast Asia. That's their backup that's their side business. What got you interested in this. And this guy said it I was like, you know the founder who messaged me he, yeah this is where get my have to bleep this but he goes, dude, every guy jacks off.

There's got to be a market what if you can, what if this is like I don't know this product you don't know this product he goes but what if this thing made it 10 times better. Isn't that crazy that there's still a taboo around this, that's going to change dude, the sex positivity thing for women it's going to affect men. I bet you you can make a modern day DTC version of the flashlight. And so I started thinking about it. And so I looking up, okay how big is this how big is this industry, and it is a pretty big industry like they do like the sex toy industry itself is about $20 billion a year.

What are the percentages to men. Women. So this is kind of I was trying to figure out the sales difference. So it's more it's dominated by female sales. So the fleshlight is the biggest of males but the female industry is much bigger, about 65% of women say that they have used one. There was a stat that said 50% of male men said that they've used one which I don't believe. I know a lot of dudes, I haven't heard one ever talk about this so maybe it's just happening on the download sex toy. I've never, I've never had one conversation with a friend.

Not a single. Yeah, so yeah so I don't know if I believe that stat but basically the European market is bigger than the American market, like places like Italy it's like super common apparently they're you know free love places the fastest growing markets right now or India and China, where it's the most taboo, but what's happened is because it's all gone to e commerce, and the e commerce companies are using very discrete packaging like they send it to you and it looks like one thing, but inside is another. And so that's the like, that's where this thing is growing and so there's a bunch of startups in this space as well that are doing like 15 million a year like love honey.

I like just just check out this traffic so the top the top website for this the top sort of Amazon for this thing is called Adam and Eve. Yeah, I was just I was just looking at Adam and Eve, because they have stores all over San Francisco. They, they have about 8 million visitors a month to their e commerce store which is a huge e commerce store. Love honey is about 4 million to their store. And what's interesting is just all these problems all this friction and trying to build one of these companies because stripe won't let you take payments.

Why wouldn't stripe let you take payments for a deal. I think they say we don't, we do not do any sexual products. So that's so so you can use Shopify but Shopify uses stripe. And so you can't do Shopify basically because stripe won't allow. So Adam and Eve love honey these companies they can't, they can't process on stripe. And so there's an opportunity I think for, for, you know, building stripe for vice products because cannabis can't use stripe and neither can any, any, any sex products porn can't use stripe. And so, if you know just those three industries alone.

That's like multiple hundreds of billions of dollars of turnover. And so who's building stripe for vice I don't know I want to go I want to go look into that. Another one of these like opportunities is is is that you can build a brand that's figures out a new form of marketing because you can't advertise on Facebook, or Instagram, or any like kind of display network that's mainstream for these products. And so I was looking into how do they get around this and I was curious, how would you get around this if you were trying to market one of these products it's an interesting sort of like job interview question I would ask somebody.

I would write articles on like, you write articles that are. Yeah, so you have to write, let me. Alright, so if we're talking about like a vibrator you write an article about like sexual health, I guess, or I don't know whatever. I mean, I would have to I would have to do research. What, what a woman who is about to buy this, what is she what type of content interests her. And I would write that article and I would display it on our brain, or I would display on. I don't know where would I display it's hard.

So I looked into how these guys are doing it and I think there's there's three. You got to go, you got to go, you can do a porn hub so they use the adult ad networks like traffic junkie and XO clicks so they advertise on porn sites basically that's a good that's a easy one. Pretty straightforward. The other thing that they do is they do heavy like content so so even though you can't advertise on on Facebook, and you can you're kind of limited on Google you can do it for certain keywords, and for just stuff that people searching for so people are searching for what is the best one I should buy what it is, you know reviews.

And so you remember how the cat the mattress company Casper was buying up the mattress review websites, and promoting Casper. So that's what these guys will do as well they'll buy up the review sites, and then they'll just put their products as the best reviewed product on there and they'll say this is you know I'm an affiliate for this for this company. So that's one way, and then the, I thought the most innovative one, and they also do like kind of direct so like you were saying, fleshlight was one of the first sponsors on Joe Rogan they'll do that they'll go direct to podcasts or newsletters that are willing to take them as a sponsor, and they'll they'll go for it there.

But the last one I thought was interesting was what fleshlight did this is a little bit this whole segment's a little bit x right it's I you know, you know, apologize if you're listening to this with kids in the car, you know I hope you've skipped forward at this point. But basically what fleshlight did was, they wanted celebrity sponsors. So what they did was, you know, Nike goes to LeBron James and says okay we want you to sponsor our stuff. So are they going to get women to be the they got they went to famous models and porn stars and they created molds.

Yes, of them. Like, you can buy the I forgot the I looked at this chart of who was the top selling skew of that. And so there's a woman Kayla or Shayla or something like that I don't remember her name was but she's some model she some points are I don't know who she is but she's famous. And they bring them in, they do a cast a cast mold of her body. And then they turn that into a product and then she can sell that product to her fans. And so I was thinking if you were going to do this now, you have only fans where, you know, I think a billion billion billion plus dollars is being paid out to their creators.

I would go to only fans creators and I would do this. I would do that model for them. I think that would be probably the strongest distribution tactic you could get. Dude, what a fascinating thing. I would you have I would invest in this but I wouldn't I would never work on this. I would never work on this. I'm zero interest in this from from, you know, like to actually like pursue it. But I do think it's one of those things that nobody talks about. And so because nobody talks about it. It's both interesting and it's surprising when you look into it how this whole system actually works so I like, you know, just like I love the Silk Road, but I would never go on the Silk Road and buy drugs but I like to look into it and see how it worked and how big it was and who was behind it and how they kept it stealthy.

Like that's fascinating to me just like I like watching prison shows, but I'm not trying to go murder anybody. I like watching you know bank heists but I'm not planning to rob anybody that's how I am with this, these types of products. So at the Adam and Eve store. What was it called. Yeah, Adam and Eve stores. I saw the we had so many locations in San Francisco we probably had three or four or five different locations. So it's a pretty huge business hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue currently owned by I believe a private equity company.

That is also another fascinating business did you research that. I don't know if you've seen that one, but I don't want other two other like interesting things about how they, how they market these things I thought was pretty clever. It just shows, you know, entrepreneurial creativity here. All right, so there's one company that's doing these like, you know, like the sort of MLM model, which, which is, you get one person who's kind of a seller for you and they have a party. So this is like the old Tupperware parties. They called them passion parties for this.

And so they have women invite their friends over and they're called passion parties where they show the different toys and what they could do or whatever. I don't know how this sounds like the most awkward party to me but apparently it's working. The second one that I thought was super interesting was they basically there was a company called diamond products and they make they make some brand of something I have no idea. And they couldn't advertise in any traditional channel. So they went and they bought Sir Richard condoms company. So they said oh condoms are allowed to be advertised on TV and on on on different websites it's more loose to like Trojan right we've all seen Trojan ads on TV for so if the restrictions are loose or there they went and bought that company and then on their website they just they upsell other products basically.

And so he went and bought this company because he goes they're sold in whole foods. He's like this makes it so easy for me to advertise because now I own this little thing is like it's my Trojan horse haha like you know this is how I advertise my sex products company. And so I thought that was pretty interesting and you know I think if you did this with Instagram models and oldie fans you could basically just copy the watch brand MVMT you could copy the movement movement watches brand model and try to you know they they went to 100 million in sales and watches I bet you could do the same using their influencer strategy.

Dude how interesting like I I love learning from these types of people I don't even like I'm I don't even like going to this I went to the flashlight website I don't even like going to that I think it's close the tab. Yeah I think it's weird I'm on my work computer just so anyone at HubSpotless yeah I apologize my my wife's dad listens to the podcast I I'm just going to tell him hey don't listen to this one I apologize if you listen to this one. Well it was a fairly academic discussion about something.

Well the worst part is now my now I'm getting retargeted like crazy because I was doing research on this for the pod and now all my ads are completely messed up. Well, do you want to talk about another interesting person. Yes. Or do you want to talk about an idea. Person make this a piece. Okay, we're going to do an interesting person. Okay, there's this guy who we're going to do Billy the week here with this guy and I by the way I think we're going to do this. We've discussed doing this every Friday maybe we will but Google by the way we need like a jingle for the Billy of the week.

It needs to be like you know the Billy of the week somebody make us a little jingle for that. That'd be pretty cool. We do need that Google Brad Kelly and make sure you spell it like brad so Brad space K e l l e y. Okay, if you're on your phone do it Brad Kelly. Now you're going to see a picture of a guy with a red beard, you see the red beard. I see it. And then two over you're going to see a picture of an old guy with a longer like he looks like like Mark Twain.

Okay, so that's the same guy the photos are just he just older now. So this guy, he's so interesting to me for a couple of different reasons so this guy's name is Brad Kelly at this point he's probably in his 60s. And he's known as the man with a million acres that was a headline that was written in the New York Times about him. And they wrote it about him, because he is one of the largest landowners in America. At this point he was number three or number four. And he's kind of known for being incredibly reclusive so he doesn't do any interviews he doesn't do anything like that, but he's bad to the bone he's a really interesting guy.

And I read a little bit about him and I've kind of got a feel for this guy and he's so intriguing to me so he was born. He was 65 years older ish. He was born in Kentucky, went to college in Kentucky but at age 19 dropped out because he started buying warehouses, and he started making enough money buying and leasing out warehouses that he goes all right I'm going to do this. I don't need school anymore. And eventually he started renting them out to people who were building stuff so creating a little miniature factories.

And he would fix them up and lease them to people. And eventually he saw that people were using them to store tobacco. And one of his tendons moved out, and he got whole he they left a machine that turned tobacco and like pumped them into cigarettes or you know like a like a rolling machine or something like that. And he was like, well I got this machine let's try it. And so he started making cheap cigarettes and eventually he rolled he made it a proper company and he called it Commonwealth brands. And if you Google Commonwealth brands I don't smoke cigarettes but I recognize some of the brands they're like, I think he has like 15 or so cigarette brands.

Yeah, it's like I think parlaments that's like when I was a kid that was like we would joke like if someone smokes parliament that mean they were like a bro kid. But he made cheap cigarettes and after 10 years he sold the cigarette company for a billion dollars. And I hate smoking and I don't think it's cool to smoke. And he doesn't either and he didn't hide that he goes I've never defended smoking and I hope that it will be phased out of society, but I did it because you know I made a living doing you know it made a living for me and using almost all of when billionaires say they they're just trying to make a living.

It's like no you made you made like a billion livings. That's a lot of livings. And with all this money he did a couple interesting things. The first thing that he did well he didn't do it first but the first interesting thing is he bought lonely planet you know lonely planet is I've heard that name what is that a dating site that's a dating site. I bet you if you look at your your book collection you might have a lonely planet book it's a travel website and book company. Okay. And it was a big it was a really big deal for many years and then when digital came along it got crushed, and he bought lonely planet for $70 million and he had us and they probably had 300 employees, and he had a kid that he liked somehow met this young guy who is 24, and he put him as CEO, and they never signed a contract they just shook hands and they go as CEO now, you know, talk to me if you need me.

Kentucky thing to do. And this kid ran it and it didn't do so hot. I mean, if like, it would have been cool if there was a better ending to that part of the story. Either to a combination of the 24 year old sucking and COVID they sold it for like 50 million so he didn't make money on it. And what he did with the rest of his money is he bought ranches and leased them back to the owners, and they make a little bit of profit but not a significant amount of profit. And at this point, he owns over a million acres in America, which is a huge huge huge amount, making him and 2012 the fourth largest landowner in America.

The guy never does interviews. You can't find him if you want to he's really hard to find. The only reason people really truly know about him is at one point he sold one of his ranchers for $400 million. Really interesting guy I like him because he's, I think that like I get caught in this world on Twitter of like, Oh, building building public, you know, what's your MRR I got to go to executive coaching. And it's so nice to hear from a guy this guy actually seems like a pretty thoughtful guy but he definitely gives off the redneck vibe.

Obviously he's highly intelligent but they say that like he goes to his ranches and he likes to drink bourbons bourbon and wear a kilt. So he's like, kind of a wild guy. He's into some weird shit. All right. But pretty interesting guy. And I wanted to bring this guy up because I bet most people would have never heard of him. But so interesting. Do you know what Kentucky Downs is? The horse horse track. Yeah, he owns that. Oh, wow. And so he just owns all types of real estate and that's what he put all of his money into.

Very interesting person. Yeah, this is this is cool. So why were you saying the part about people who have like executive coaches and what was the contrast there to explain that one. Like, I see people who've got like small ass companies who like are not even there. They're like barely just started and they're like tweeting out like leadership quotes, or they're talking about like how they need to be more inclusive at their company or this and that. And I just get sick of this hype thing and I see all the people like, oh, build in public.

And I'm guilty of all this as well. But like all the and we're part of the hype cycle, right? We're media, but it's cool to see someone who you've never heard of who just is anonymous and shuts the fucks up and just works and does cool stuff and has a cool life. And it's entirely like, you know, everyone's like, I got in a fight on Twitter about people which about buying domain names. You think this guy knows how to buy a domain name. And one of the interviews he said he doesn't know how to use email.

Right. Yeah, this guy's not vegan. Yes. No, this guy eats vegans. Right. This guy is made of leather. Yeah, okay, so you just like that these like kind of like a tough guy, rough guy, business guy doesn't give a fuck. And everybody else, you know, makes such a big deal of little things is kind of I just think it's cool to see to hear different perspectives and I'm sure that he does a lot of bad stuff. I mean, you know, the cigarette company right like that's kind of pretty shitty, but it was just cool. It's cool to have a different perspective.

And this guy if you Google him, I'm pretty sure there's only three pictures that I've I've researched this guy a lot. I've only found three pictures of him. And he's worth three or four billion dollars. I like it. All right, he is indeed the Billy of the week. I wonder, I wonder who I wonder how people will will react to this guy because I think some people are like so anti cigarettes that they're like, you are, you know, that you're saying that you, you kind of idolizing this guy who is a, you know, who did bad things like a warlord almost.

And so I don't know, you're the one who also said you would not invest in jewel, right? Was it you? Yeah, look, I'm not I'm not defending this person's actions. I think but I think that no matter how evil or horrible someone is, there's you can always find something interesting, maybe saying admirable is a bit of a stretch, but you can always find something interesting no matter how bad someone is and I don't think this guy is necessarily a bad guy. But yeah, he I mean, he fucking he's so poison. Yeah, it's pretty right. I think of it, I think, I don't know, maybe I'm a little disconnected from reality but for me, I'm like, I don't like movies where everybody is a good guy, I would not play a game, a video game, where you just walk around as a good Samaritan like those aren't fun to me.

And I think that the real world has all kinds of people shapes, colors beliefs all all kinds of different things. And I'm interested in the variety of ways that people live their life and I'm glad that people live their life doing all these different things, even though a lot of them are like villains or a lot of them. I'm not saying this guy's a villain but like, I think that's just the way the world is and I think it's crazy to believe that the world shouldn't be that way or won't be that way, where people are going to live their life doing different things maybe this guy likes to drink bourbon and wear a kilt on a farm that he owns like, alright, great, I'm glad that character exists.

I'm glad that that that, you know, I'm glad these characters exist I think that most people will not feel that way most people will say well, this person's a bad guy. You know, he shouldn't exist and I don't know. I find that to be this is not the way I think about it. I believe every great man or every great woman is also a bad man. So, well, what I mean by that is, if you are at all if you're considered great at anything, or one of the best, inevitably you have many enemies because you can't make everyone happy.

So, I'm going to start now. By the way, can you tweet that out so I'm doing this thing. I'm getting behind me. What one of the things that's going to go behind me is I'm, I'm getting these laser etched signs that are tweets basically it's called laser tweets calm. And so, you could basically get any tweet turned into a wooden laser etched sign. And I'm going to put I'm going to hang a couple of my favorite quotes and tweets behind me. And one of them one of my favorites is every great man is also a bad man.

And so I need you to tweet that out so that I can do it. But what you can't do is you can or you can do person. If you if you want to not make it gender specific here, but I need you to tweet that out so I can get that one made. You're going to get on my wall. I don't think I may I think I made up that phrasing but I read it in a book and I don't remember exactly how they phrased it but that's how I phrased it. But I believe it to be true.

And dude, I did so much research on this guy that I went and I went to land forums. So really interesting research tactic that you should do is you type in whatever you're searching for, like flashlight and then you type in forum. Right. And then you are brought to user generated content of message boards and what people are saying, or you could do the same thing but you just type in the word Reddit. It's pretty sick. I went to the land forums where this guy bought people's land and they go yeah you know, or someone's like hey this guy named Brad Kelly offered to buy my land.

Who sold to him and people are like yeah we sold to him. He's fine enough done done bother us and offered us a fair deal. And so they're like well and we all and people said well and we read about him doing cigarettes and that kind of sucks but he's ever caused us a problem. So anyway, every great man is also a bad man. Okay, did you want to do any any of these other ones or are we saving them. I think this one should, they should be saved. Okay I have one quick one because I don't really have much to say but we talked or we could do the NBC one.

Okay I'm going to do a one quick plug for these guys that took an idea we talked about and they made it. So we talked about levels that fyi, which is a salary comparison website we had a whole episode about like open salaries and should you or should you not transparent data how that helps blah blah blah. Okay, levels does this for the tech industry where you can go see alright if I'm a Facebook product manager level five. What will I make if I live in Seattle what will I make if I live in San Francisco.

What's the benchmark what are the meat what is some data so I know if I'm getting if I'm getting hosed if they gave me a fair job offer or not fair job offer. And so we said dude somebody should do this for other industries because this is awesome. Why isn't this happening and others so these guys made med levels.fi and it's basically doctor pay. And so they if you go to it. You can see they don't have a ton of data yet, but they're getting some they're getting doctors to put in how much they're getting paid based on where they live and what type of doctor they are.

I think it's great super simple. It's just basically an air table displayed on a website so really easy to build and shout out. It's Google forums I think. Yeah, I'm saying like a theory right it's like such a simple, simple product to do so med levels that if I get good job by those guys. And if you're a doctor listening go put your shit in there. Yeah, it's pretty cool. I was looking at this. Alright, we'll wrap it up by talking about one more thing and maybe we should put this in the beginning but let me ask you how has your angel investing gone so far.

I'll tell you in 10 years that's the problem with angel investing. But how many deals have you invested in. I think a little under 20 maybe like 18 something like that 18 companies we've invested in deployed about, I don't know million and a half $2 million something like that. And do you feel confident that you have some winners. Yeah, definitely there's some winners. Now we'll see I think anything anything anything can happen but I would say I'd be surprised if out of these 18. If we don't have, you know, two companies that are worth a billion dollars or more I'd be surprised.

So, wow, that's pretty sick. So we, um, a few weeks ago, I tweeted out something that Andrew Chen said basically I asked Andrew Chen who's a partner at Andreessen Horowitz what his advice to me for angel investing was and he told me his opinion and I tweeted that out. People shit on me, even though I was like I'm not saying this I'm just, or I'm just like, I'm the messenger. Yeah, like I'm just like reporting on someone interesting opinion but I did tend to agree on a couple of the things. And one of them was that there's this narrative that you there's this narrative of people who hate VC and they're like I would rather grow slower and it's like okay that's cool.

Do that. But in order and they also say profits matter, you know, like and they love to mock Silicon Valley companies are like dude, these guys, you know, they don't know anything about profits. So sorry, I'm just over here running a profitable business just growing steady every year. And so they like to get on that kind of high horse, which is crazy because like both can exist and be wonderful. But there was this guy who I really like and I don't mean to shit on him at all. It was called Indy VC. And it was, it was kind of weird I don't know why it was a venture capital firm because its whole stick was basically we invest in bootstrap businesses that want to grow slowly.

They didn't exactly say slowly but it was for bootstrapped companies which is, again a little bit of an oxymoron why is a bootstrap company going to be taking capital. Right. But a lot of people really liked it and the guy who ran it I forget his name, I met with him awesome guy, and they went out of business this week. And I think his name. Bryce, I like Bryce Bryce is a good guy, but the model didn't work. And I wanted to bring this up because something that Andrew said was, he said two things he was saying.

He said two things he was said, invest in quantity. So just kind of throw money at a bunch of stuff so like anything that seems promising just kind of mindlessly invest in it. And second, make sure it's growing three X a year if it's not that it's not good and a lot of people didn't like when I said that. And they didn't like it I think because it kind of hurt their feelings of like, well, you're saying I'm not worthy of venture capital and the answers is, is, yeah, you're not. Right. You're not and but that's okay that doesn't like you shouldn't be offended.

Right, you don't have to shut down your business that just means this type of asset this type of venture, you know venture capital is chasing a certain profile a company and you may not fit that profile. And by the way, I think that most people, I bet you. I mean this sounds so juicy. I bet you I've made significantly more money than a lot of people who have raised. Absolutely. And so I was telling somebody this day of the day I was like, I was like, you know, media companies were talking about media companies. And you know, you guys just sold your you guys are media company.

And it wasn't the biggest exit ever it's not like, you know, some insane thing. But I was like, dude, he, I don't how much did you raise total like a million and a half dollars $2 million something like that. A million. A million dollars right. So it took so little money and and not so give the give the profile was a million dollars and it took you how many years from start to finish. Not finished but when we quit it. Start as we raised money to finish less than five years and I made eight eight figures.

Right, exactly. And so and you owned, you know, majority of the business or whatever so like, because you didn't have to raise all this money and dilute yourself over and over and over again from round after round after round. Like there are, if you look at companies that are selling for a billion dollars where the founder owns 4% or 2% or 7% and you know, it's not like and they and they sweated it for 10 years, and every hair on their head is gray, because because of that path so it doesn't. The size of the exit is not not linked really to the to the outcome for the for the founder themselves.

I agree, which proves that we're not. I know for speaking to myself and I think you you're not shitting on this, this idea of anti VC whatever, but this company went out of business and it goes against this narrative of like, if you're going to give money to venture capital or companies that fit the profile of VC you want them to be what many would think or describe as reckless. Right. And one thing I didn't get. Why did they go out of business so so basically they couldn't raise more money was the idea. Right. That's how a VC fund goes out of business.

And he said in his thing he's like we invested in 10 companies or whatever he gave some numbers so so tell me that he goes, they were all bootstrapped and profitable, and they're all going and they're 40. He said something like, we've invested in these they're all still going they're all still profitable, but we couldn't raise any more money. I said what what do you, I don't understand what what is his reason why did they go out of business he kind of sounded like he was crying a little bit like, he was kind of whining because he's like, our LPs didn't like our model so they pulled the plug because you know whatever.

I didn't read the thing very carefully so you tell me you know I mean, yeah, why is he saying they failed. I don't think he was whining I think he was just saying the fact that like most people don't like this idea, and weren't really to stick it out and I don't blame them, because if you go to Indie dot VC the website, it's a video of a unicorn head on fire, as if like they're anti unicorn and I my hands are good if his returns are good, every people would still be looking to back the fun because people who invest in the returns aren't as good as other stuff like right.

So that's what he needs to say is not that people don't like this he needs to say, I was wrong, my returns weren't as good as I thought they would be and they were not good enough to get more money, because people invest I invest in VC funds. I also would invest in real estate which has a different profile. I'll invest in crypto which has a different return risk return profile. I invest in many things. And so, that's why I thought it was kind of whining because I didn't, it didn't just say the honest truth.

I said that this would be a great way to invest, and my returns were actually shitty, and therefore, I couldn't raise more money. And either that's true, or his returns were actually good and he sucked at going and getting new investors I didn't, there's only two ways to go about it right like I didn't understand. I didn't I stopped reading because I didn't he wasn't saying the truth in my opinion. Well, I mean he said the truth he said that, like our strategy, a lot of LPs bailed. It cost us 80% of our LP base they didn't want to come back.

And it was just yeah the strategy didn't, didn't work in the sense of investors. Did he post his returns. No. That's the thing he needed to say right he's saying they didn't like our strategy it was so he was kind of just like patting himself in the back I felt he's like they didn't like that we were going against the grain going against the VC thing and they had to pull out because of that it's like well, is it that they didn't like what you were doing, or is it that it wasn't working and the returns weren't very good and they didn't believe the returns were going to be very good.

I don't know. I'm being harsh on the guy I don't know the guy but no he's cool and I'm not bringing this up to show them I think it's cool it took a shot. It was a bad shot though and that's that's great right you take swings sometimes miss for sure. But I think though it's important. It's important that we look at what this what's what does this mean here and I think that someone like Andrew Chen who's this from the outside you think of him as like an elitist like went to I don't know he just like give this vibe that he's like an elitist he's like the lead a step a guy.

But, and so and he kind of represents a lot of people like him right these like VCs who like oh like fuck these tech bros. And the reality is those that that strategy of like doing stuff that appears to be reckless from the outside. It is the right strategy it just feels really uncomfortable for a lot of people. If you if you if you it's a classic don't hate the play I hate the game. It's not that the it's not that VCs decided oh you know what I'll do. I'm going to invest in a bunch of companies and one or two will return the fund and everything else will go to zero.

It's not that they want that right that's actually extremely stressful for them. Okay, if I get into this company that becomes a $10 billion plus company, I'm a hero and I'm the best. And if I just miss them, and I invest in a bunch of other good companies that didn't quite get there. I suck and I can't raise my next fund and I'm out of a job. And. And so, so it's crazy to me that like, they're not picking this that just is the nature of the game and they have to play it if they want to succeed at it.

It's like in any game theory. And the game will the players in the game will eventually find the meta game the strategy that is the optimal strategy. And if you just because of your like, you know, your opinion and your personality and your morals don't want to play it cool that's fine but you're just not going to get, you're not going to be playing the optimal strategy you're going to eventually lose the game. And so I think it's crazy that people hate the VCs when it's just that's the way that innovation works. The innovations that break through become humongous and the innovations that don't become zeros and or close to zeros and the winners are so big that that's they dominate all the returns.

But then there's this other ground where it's like FVC which me personally I'm on that boat, where I want to be a VC but I don't want to take VC money. And that's this other group of people and it's like, dude, they all can exist. And that's why that quote is so insightful right don't hate the player hit the game cool you can hit the game that's allowed. That's in the quote. You're allowed to hate the game and say I'm going to play a different game. No problem you can play games where you bootstrap or you don't raise VC money where you don't do business at all you go be an employee somewhere no problem.

That's always an option. Well, I guess we just did a little rant but I wanted to bring that up. We'll see if this episode turns out to be anything interesting. I'll bring you how we do. B plus I want the graphics guys like slam a big B plus all over the screen. Alright, why B plus you got to give give the people that your explanation why why why you saying what you're saying. I mean, it was good research but it just wasn't as juicy as it could be it was good. I've never seen Sean more animated than we talked about flashlights by the way.

Yeah, I was super into that to be honest, I got ruined when I went to the website it's pretty fricking disgusting. Did you go to the website. I did all my research I didn't go to their website. It's not great. It's pretty gross. But no I think it's interesting I think what we'll have to do is. I think, like, if we did an entire episode on flashlight or entire episode on this guy Brad Kelly, I think it would be crazy fascinating. I thought I thought I was saying I went too much into it. No, the flesh was the best part I'm just saying you're very animated about it.

Yeah, I would do and I have room I have space but it's cold so I have to talk in an animated way to like not. You're passionate about flesh lights. So I've been listening I listen to a true crime podcast every night which is weird that I'm in bed like with my wife about to go to sleep hearing about like how this guy just like murdered and raped these people. But it's this one lately called generation why it's really popular and all it is is two guys discussing crimes and mysteries ranging from 911 to serial murders to the Bermuda triangle, all that all that type of thing and all they're doing is talking and retelling a story, we should definitely just do that with one interesting person.

Yeah, I think that's great. Although, if it's not true crime I don't know how interesting people how interested people would be in it. If you told a 60 to 70 to 90 minutes story in the same way that you told that flashlight story. People would love it. I could tell because I mean I could, I was enthralled by it. What's the first story we could tell. How could we try it. Well, one time we talked about this, the French Bill Gates that that guy was so intriguing to me. I mean, you can do 60 minutes that's like you can really only tell like your own story or like some something you really go or like a, you know, the American Kingpin story you can like retell it retell the book basically as a podcast.

Well that's what you're doing at the end of the day which is you're just reading 15 articles and you're telling the long story about it. And what you could do is one of us is the more, more researched, and the other one listens and asks questions. Okay, I'm down to try it if you have an idea. Am I wrong about you. I mean it could work. I'm just I don't know how you can make it that exciting, like true crime. There's suspense there's mystery you know what's gonna happen. I guess business maybe like big business scandals you could do that with.

No dude, you do it exactly like you did the flash. The origin stories. Yeah, I think origin stories are good right that's what I tried to do with the flesh like guy was like, basically you tell how this thing came to be. So I think you could do it that way. It works. I, but I agree with John I don't know how you get 60 to 90 minutes out of it. I think you basically forget the six parameters that doesn't matter it could be 20 minutes. There's no issue but it's like just a well told story a well researched and therefore well told story about something that happened.

I honestly know like for me I started listening to this YouTube channel that basically is like it's like book summaries, but actually done good. I actually like it. And what's it called a productivity game as a YouTube is a YouTube channel with about half a million I think subscribers or something like that. I might I could be wrong that there's a lot of subscribers. But I've listened to probably 10 of their books I'm raised up just books I've had I bought. I just haven't got to I'm like do I really want to go read like made to stick, or can I just like watch the seven minute video and like, Oh those are the four principles of the stick cool.

I still might read the book but now I know if it's like interesting or not. And so similarly, I'm reading like, you know whether it's like, for example I read this book PayPal, whatever the PayPal origin story or whatever. If we just retold that. It's like, you know, just take the book and then turn it into a 20 minute retelling of the story. I think that's pretty, that could be pretty well I know that would work. I think that would be great. There's this awesome podcast called we study billionaires which sounds lame but honestly it's like, you guys know it's they're huge and it's really good.

And they'll read a book on someone or just a belong article and just retell the story. Right. It's really good I love this podcast it's called the investors podcast. We never heard of this. That's in Pish. Yeah, either good man. I know they're thumbnail the red thumbnail. They're huge yeah. They're huge downloads they have. So that would work. I'm a fan boys. I guess we should publish us talking right now but speaking of books you know what I'm doing is this isn't the one I'm doing with it. I'm just going to read one book this year but I'm going to study the fuck out of it.

I'm sick of reading like two books a month and not remembering anything. For me like YouTube is just so much better like I'm just going deep on like, you know, like Charlie Munger Peter Lynch YouTube stuff and I'm just like watching watching so many of their videos are listening to their videos and there's just a lot of wisdom in there and Charlie Munger said this thing he's like, he's like I don't want to read the news. He goes I want to read something that it made sense 30 years ago, it makes sense today, it's going to make sense 30 years from now.

And I'd rather just read that 10 times than read like whatever the latest thing is and that's kind of what you're saying. Yeah, I agree. All right, well, let's bounce. I'm gonna get my shit set up by the next podcast better.
