I know the Koch Brothers, I saw you putting this in the Facebook group that you were You were sort of summarizing what you had learned. What is the TLDR? So all I know is Koch Brothers Super rich old white guys that I think support like you know the conservative party. So what do I need to know besides that? Sam what's up? Hey, I'm looking at an email that I just got from milk bar. They have a Peanut butter and jelly birthday cake my birthday's in a few days if anyone has a If anyone's thinking about me All right, if someone's thinking about you, what should they do just buy me that cake What is milk bars is a brand of cake yeah started because what's that guy in New York Chang Mike? What's his name David David Chang David Chang he He started the like Mama Fuku bars and they decided to open up a dessert area Now that's spun off to its own thing called milk bar and they make trendy cakes.

I ordered one the other day. It's pretty good How long does it take for it to get to you a week? Oh? Man see that's the problem. Not I'm never a thoughtful a week in advance I'm like the day of I'm like I'm gonna do something but I need something that can get done that day It looks delicious. Can we talk about Austin? Yeah, you're in Austin. Okay. I've been in Austin for three weeks now. I'm gonna come home on Saturday Austin is Lovely it is a great place Sean is like is everyone in San Francisco gonna leave No, everyone's is not gonna leave.

I'm looking at the some people are leaving I'm looking at so I have a place in San Francisco. I pay like five grand a month or something four to five grand a month and I Am Live in it's like a thousand or 1100 square feet with a garage I'm living in a place that's probably $3,000 a month and it's like a 2,000 square foot house with the backyard and like furnished Like what am I doing? Yeah, but the thing is you can go even further with that because like when I grew up I lived in a whole bunch of different countries I lived in Indonesia.

I lived in China and there it's like, you know, go to Indonesia You live like a king you can go live in Bali on the beach with a cook and a driver For the same amount you're paying in Austin, right? So this kind of this arbitrage of like cost of living it really never ends. So be careful Yeah, I'm just it's making me question my life I look on Zillow all the time at for buying a home in San Francisco and the prices are dropping like crazy It says like a hundred fifty thousand two hundred thousand dollar cut off of everything.

Are you gonna have to cut on your house? Hopefully not if you're if you're the buyer listening to this. I'm not taking one penny less than asking That's my position. Oh, do you have someone who's gonna buy it now? No, no, I don't know. I haven't listed it yet, but soon good and So your friends you have a lot of friends leaving San Francisco. I have friends who were already in the process of it This just kind of accelerated it. So Some people just lifestyle wise ready to go some people when they're like, well if I'm not working from home and commuting I don't need to be here.

So yeah, definitely this is accelerated people out But it also feels like things are opening back up. So I think that you know things can change People can feel differently as soon as life gets a little bit back to normal You never know what well people will feel like so We'll see as things open up I'm very eager. So you want to stop you want to talk about some interesting stuff? Yeah, you got one. Yeah, I got one so I I Know I try to get a get past media, but I just I love it so much.

Okay, so Jeff Bezos Bezos Bezos Amazon guy he owns Washington Post and a few years ago. He goes, you know, I'm gonna buy and I'll let the editorial dudes thing and whatever else I'm gonna stay out of it But I kind of want to take your guys's they built their own technology to publish their articles Like I kind of want to take that make that like a huge business and a lot of people try this and never in very rarely works But what he did was or he didn't do it, but he was somehow part of it They've created this thing called art publishing and it does a couple things the first thing is Companies like me paid money to use it, but it's really interesting that you and I have talked about this idea But what art publishing is doing is they're going to companies like BP The oil company that has 200,000 companies and they are saying hey BP You have you know 200,000 employees We're gonna help you publish newsletters and articles and stuff to your to your employees Which you already are but we're gonna help you organize it make sure it's read things like that And they're saying that in the next year or two, they're gonna hit a hundred million in revenue Wow, which means I bet Washington Post probably does maybe 500 million in revenue in total But a hundred million in this enterprise sass revenue would be worth more than Washington Post is and I wanted to get your opinion on a that's a cool idea That you and I had been noodling with for a while and they're just executing on a really interesting way and be the idea of branching out from your main thing to doing more and Yeah, like something a totally unrelated thing in some ways.

It's totally a stupid I mean, so there's an argument to be made like this is just a stupid idea never do it There's an argument to be made that a lot of people do it successfully. So what's your take on this? So first this I've never heard of our so this is my first time hearing about it just to clarify They give other brands or other companies the tools that Washington Post So they sort of productize their own toolkit, but is it always like the use case you talked about like? BP want has 50,000 employees wants to publish internally or is it also external publishing? I Think that they're still trying to figure it out And I think that they're building it for a variety of reasons at first It was just for publishers and then be they closed this deal with BP and they I think to them they're like, huh Maybe that's the way that's the right No, I think there's something to that because you know when when I started the podcast I used to go to this podcast studio before you guys built a dope studio in your office I was going to this like kind of rent a studio by the hour place And I was talking to the guy who did it and he was like they had a sports radio station on 24 7 sports radio station And then they were like well, we know how to build the studio we built one for them What if we turned a few conference rooms into? Broadcasting booths and we did probably we offered it to podcasters these hipsters in SF.

They love this shit And so they didn't say by the way in San Francisco. They're there. There are no studio They're basically the only one and trust me, right? Yeah, and so I went there and I was like, hey Can I get 11 a.m. Tomorrow? And he's like no we're booked up from 11 to 3 I'm like shit who else who are the podcasters using this and he was like, oh, this is Facebook they I was like Facebook He's like, yeah, they have an internal podcast that they do for their employees because Facebook has I don't know Tens of thousands of employees maybe 50,000.

I don't know But they have managers who come in and record a podcast about managing at Facebook and it gets distributed only internally And I was like I never heard of a internal only podcast that a company was doing but of course, you know makes sense People want to put out content Training, you know different things like that whether it's in text or audio form That was my first time hearing about these like internal publishing systems that I had never really considered And that is what arc is trying to do and like Facebook that has Fit I don't know what do they have 20,000 employees some tens of thousands of people They need to create a lot of this stuff like hey everyone.

So here's how we're addressing This situation here's what we're gonna say. Here's the words we're using Yada yada yada or we're quitting this product. Here's why yada yada yada Here's how to use the internal software yada yada yada It's a great idea. I think and you and I had discussed a slight variation of this, but I Want the listeners to tweet at me and tell me And I always hit the idea when people say like oh, I can't do this already exists But I just want to know does this exist who is solving this problem? Yeah, we've talked okay We've talked about a few variations of this.

So let's go over them. So this is all in the bubble of the theme of what I'll call I Mean I want to say internal publishing because that sounds lame as shit, but basically Intra company stuff so I'll think of a good name in a second But basically we talked about Q&A. Sorry all hands software because you know Big companies do all hands for their whole employee base also individual you know divisions will do all hands for their group and What you need there is video streaming you need chat or Q&A A functionality, but it needs to be private it needs to be internal It needs to be behind a wall that nobody else can get to this So a lot of people already have video streaming services out there, but that's for mass, you know, it's like YouTube.

It's twitch It's things for to go get a big audience, but this is for a select audience a little bit different So we talked about that one we talked about when we were we were going over Hemingway and how it makes you a better writer We were saying what if you could do this for? Internal your emails inside a company, but also just a mail chimp for your company. So how do somebody get the word out within a company? How do they make nicely formatted easy to read? You know company announcements and bulletins that come with the kind of tools that mail chimp has like tracking opens and clicks and that sort of thing So that's an internal mail chimp internal podcasting what these guys are doing is basically internal You know Washington Post which is like a whole bunch of different Features and functionality they have they these guys have you know broadcasting like live streaming they have blogging they have Are you reading though the website? Yeah, I'm going through their products They have a huge set of things basically everything you would need to make watching post So I think that's just an interesting thing to think about What if you took the best in class products that people use to publish and broadcast to large audiences and you said how? Do companies need this just for internal broadcasting internal? Announcements I remember my brother in law.

He owns gyms He owned like 50 gyms and he was like yeah, dude I just need an easy way to mass text all my employees on a text list The kind of numbers for the day and any key announcements about what we're trying to do He's like you'd be surprised It's really hard to like get this stuff set up and get this make this a part of the onboarding of my company so that yeah Everybody knows they should join that's the SMB Version like this small business version Which is also a good idea and then the second thing you talked about is you know When do you when do you do this? When do you take your eye off your core business and how do you expand into other lines of businesses? I think that's you know generically a hard thing and it's a case by case thing You have plenty of examples where it worked and it becomes a huge business unit It let's call AWS being the best example of this where Amazon takes its own sort of server and compute system and services system It makes it available to any company and now AWS brings in you know tens of billions of dollars a year and So that's like the best case scenario and then you have a probably you know Hundreds of thousands of other examples that you can come up with where somebody does this it doesn't take off It becomes a distraction etc.

Etc. And you guys have considered this too. So how do you guys think about this? Yeah, so when we consider everyone says the same thing they go well Amazon did it Let's just make AWS for them and I'm like well you have to understand that Amazon did it like ten years into the business when they were 10,000 employees and Throwing 250 people at that problem is a ain't no thing and so at my company's like yeah Okay, I could hire a person like I have no problem a couple people like doing it But you do need to get like your main thing right first that said I struggle with it because I have ADD And I want to I want to do this shit So it's hard.

I don't know what like twitch. I bet twitches in the same boat They're big enough that they can have these same projects and a lot of the infrastructure that they probably are built on I bet they had to make a lot of it from scratch Absolutely, I don't know so twitch is ten years into the business and you're right They invented essentially the best in class let's say live video streaming at scale You can have hundred thousand people all watching one channel with low latency and it doesn't fall over and Broadcasting around the world nobody else really had that problem so nobody else built a solution And so you could imagine that twitch could say hey We could make this available to others and that they could spin it out as its own business unit and I think that might be a good decision right because You're taking an asset you've already have that you've received that you've refined that sort of Battle tested and brandable right like your sales pitches.

Hey, we use this for the biggest live streaming network, you know out there But at the same time it's a distraction and they wouldn't have done it year one two or three They you know could do it at year ten because at that point your core is stable It's not going anywhere. It's not gonna die and so you know I always make these analogies and I don't know if my team really likes it But I always talk about like you know the startup is like a baby and like with a baby And like with a baby a baby just they need to eat they need to sleep they need to poop and nothing else matters Like you don't need to teach a baby calculus right now.

You don't need to you know do all this other stuff and But as it becomes a teenager or gets ready to go to go off for college, you know, you don't have to watch it so intently You don't have to worry about is it gonna you know Keeping the baby alive every single day. That's the main objective of this early stage But as you get later stage, you don't have to worry about that which lets you what why don't they like that's a good analogy Why don't they like it? I think it's because I'm always like right now.

We just got to keep the baby alive and it's just like sort of a Dark a darker way of talking about it But like I did this with one of our companies in the idea lab I was like we had one company that was already mature. It was already profitable making millions of dollars and we had this other project That was totally unproven and so anytime you had to decide where do I spend an hour? It always seemed like a good idea to spend it on the thing that's making millions in profit never to spend it on the Never to spend it on the super speculative thing, but if we did that we would have never invested in the new thing And so I made a decision.

I said hey We can't have the the baby and the teenager in the same room because they have totally different needs they need different type of care and You know one will always look feeble and weak compared to the other But that one that's feeble week today has the most growth potential and so we need to be investing in that too And so let's split these two companies up and let's spin them out. What about um You do you think yet you are like me where you have ADD and you like starting stuff or are you the opposite where you like to run it? I have ADD in the sense that I like I am attracted to doing a new thing I'm attracted to new strategies new ideas, but the second part of your question was do you like to run it or not run it? Of course in my ideal world, I don't have to run it Somebody else runs it takes the idea to fruition and I get to own the whole thing, but in reality I found that that is much harder To implement doesn't mean it's impossible much harder to implement Yeah, this is an interesting discussion.

I was reading about Coke coke land about the coke brothers, you know that is I Know the coke brothers. I saw you putting this in the Facebook group that you were You were sort of summarizing what you had learned. What is the TLDR? So all I know is coke brothers super rich old white guys that I think support like, you know, the conservative party So what do I know besides everything that you've just said is the stereotype about them that 99% of people think is about them and the reason I wanted to read the book about them was it was just interesting But what I learned is they're far more rich than that not in terms of money, but they're much richer character They kind of get paid now.

I'm not saying that they don't do evil stuff But they get paid as these old white guys who control the conservative party in reality They're quite libertarian and they actually give money to all types of charities I mean they give a lot of money to gay rights organizations because one of the brothers is is gay they give a lot of money to prison reform because they don't want people to they think the criminal justice system is screwed up and They're very principled and it just so happens that the Republicans definitely do a lot of the stuff that they want to give money to But they go across the board there and The way that they got started was the father started an oil company and that oil company was somewhat successful like it was making 30 million dollars a year in American Or sorry in today's dollar in profit.

So like successful very successful, but the 31 year old brother Charles took it over when the father died and turned it into the largest privately owned business in America and And so he took something that did 30 million dollars a year in profit to now probably like 10 billion dollars a year in profit and got out of oil. What did they do with? Yeah, so what they did was that they took their 30 million They they owned an oil refinery and they did a combination of things including so the thing about oil is it goes through this tower and oil turns into gasoline but then then the leftover stuff turns into kerosene and the leftover stuff turns into Vaseline and leftover stuff turns into propane and so they just started like selling all the leftover stuff and they took those profits and then bought different companies so they you know bounty paper towels They make those a lot of the paper that newspapers printed on they make that a lot of It's called.

What's that? Gore tech is it called Gore tech? What's like it's like a loot and loop raha. Is it loop raha? That's the material that Nike makes shoes out of that's really strong. It's like that plastic They made they oh they make that so they just make stuff that originally started as oil But now it's expands, but it's still like making stuff and Their operations are basically This like let's just like start a lot of start or buy a ton of stuff And it all started with one thing and that's kind of one of the reasons why I'm interested in this topic.

I like that a lot a that was just a great description and be that totally changes my Like kind of like expands the stereotype I had of the Koch brothers in my head You know, I never brought bother to sort of look under the hood and be like what is this? What how do they get rich? Are they really just the sort of evil Manipulators of the conservative party type of thing or is there more depth to it? So that's kind of interesting I'm not saying that they're I don't think they are evil I think that they do some things that they're some of the things they do A lot of people particularly liberal people strongly disagree with but I told you In my core, I don't think they're evil.

I told you about my friend My friend who I'm like this guy's gonna be a billionaire. He's like 22 years old I'm like this guy's gonna be a billionaire someday he He interviewed with the Koch brothers to be their like head of investments or something like that and He was like pretty far down the interview process and I was like dude Do you feel like you know a certain type of way that it's you know, the Koch brothers or whatever? He was like he's he's just laughed. He's just like his money green. Okay money's green.

Thank you. That's all I care about He's like I he's so ruthless about the way he he looks at these things I find it hilarious and ultimately he didn't do it because either a they didn't offer enough or B I think they're based out of like Kansas or Nebraska or something like that. Which it all Kansas Which it on he was like, yeah, I don't know if I want to go live in Wichita for X number of years to do this So he ultimately pulled out. Well, if he got offered and he didn't take it.

He's an idiot, but I'm sure he'll figure out his way Okay, that's that's pretty interesting. I like the anything else on the Koch brothers Otherwise, I like that that's sort of I would say that's the Billy of the week then in this case That's yeah, I'll finish it up with I'm reading Koch land and so that is a book that has a It's it's clearly trying to be negative about them It's still a great read and then there's sons of Wichita, which is their biography which tries to be objective and then there's another book called it's it's it's Either called one of them is called good profit and then the other one's called market based management and describes the Koch brothers management philosophy and it's incredibly interesting nice, okay, I like that Yeah, I just started reading a lot more recently and it's like the best decision.

I made which sounds like stupid It's not even like worth talking about but the reality is there's probably a lot of people like me who Like to read go through these phases where you like intensely read and then like don't read anything for two years And if you're that person like just do it go back to the reading thing. It's great I just did it and I don't regret it at all. I'm reading this thing called the happy body Which is like really interesting. It's about The these guys who study Weightlifters they basically are like, you know, what what should you strive for with fitness? And they're like well you should strive for these like three four things that You know, you don't want to be a bodybuilder where you're just strong, but you're slow and you're inflexible You don't want to be a baby where you're super flexible, but you're weak You want to be X and they start to outline it and there's all these little tests And so I'm always doing them and making my wife do them like okay standing at the wall standing at the wall Raise your hands above your head and I'm gonna count the points of contact against the wall Okay, here's how you are in terms of you know body You know your your alignment or your posture or whatever it is So there's all these little tests which is makes it a lot more fun to read then I'm gonna buy this Are you doing this because you feel like you're getting old? I'm doing it because it came recommended.

I think Somebody somebody said this is a great book and then the other thing is I'm I basically believe that everything that the sort of common knowledge about food and fitness is just so like Confusing bullshit and like contradicts itself so so frequently that I'm looking for better like source material like not sell me a fad diet or a new, you know P90X this book reads almost like a textbook and I find that a lot more appealing because I don't feel like I'm being sold to some program or some you know Diet and products and shit like that.

So that's why I'm buying it. I'm getting it. I'm gonna read it And we will have all right. I got two ideas for you that are both based on zoom Actually, I have a better idea. Let me go to the better idea first. Okay, so Did you see today's snapchat? Did a like I did they're like developer conference thing? Yeah, tell me about that thing that they introduced so they introduced a few things and they were like, hey, you know last time We introduced games and games are doing great and they were talking about they are just kind of hyping up games to get more people to build mini games on snapchat But they introduced other things called minis and minis is actually I think a bigger move by them So minis are basically mini applications Built into snapchat.

What they're doing is they're copying we chat, which is the big messaging app in China We chat has like a million little apps built in like oh you need to pay your bills you just do it through we chat and How do you do that? Well, there's this little mini website that the you know The utility company makes that'll just pop up in your we chat and you hit pay and it's paid or you want to do this You want to buy movie tickets together? You do it within we chat like we don't do that in iMessage We don't do that in Facebook Messenger, but that's what all these companies would love to they'd love to be we chat here in the States So snapchat's taking a big stab at doing that and they announced like so for example one of the minis is Headspace so you can do like sort of a quick meditation with anybody else on like one of your friends from snapchat They did a movie ticket buying thing.

They did you know, so they did several of these And so the stock at I Don't know how the socks doing but what what's interesting here is that? Snapchat sort of in a position where they have to become a platform to compete because Facebook and Instagram have sort of just Declared like we will steal your we took your mojo already And if you come up with some new great mojo like guess what you know, Evan Spiegel You're the head of product at Facebook actually whatever you come up with we are going to put in our apps as soon as humanly possible So their only strategy they have basically two core strategies one is Maybe they can create snap glasses these like AR glasses and they can just sort of get off the cell phone game and get into the glasses game before anybody else So that would be like a what's a snap mini website.

What do you call that? They call them snap minis and what they are are little mini websites that that can pop up and be little like utility things to do inside snapchat besides message each other Now the second thing is becoming a platform because Facebook and Instagram don't do a great job of letting other companies build shit on top of them people distrust those companies They built apps on top of Facebook and messenger before and gotten screwed and so they don't have great ecosystems So snapchats kind of pushing their chips into the middle of the table and saying come build shit on us Will treat you better than those guys will and you kind of believe it You kind of believe it because it's really their only way to compete with Facebook and Facebook So they kind of have to actually honor this so anyways a quick idea so in general I think that being early to these platforms and these app App ecosystems is a good thing.

There's been several snap kit apps that have been like number one and number two on the app store So they've gotten a shit ton of distribution from it What's a snap kit app snap kit is basically the tool set that snapchat gives you to build to build stuff So it's like okay snap kit will say you want to access their bitmoji cool snap kit lets you just type one line and you get their bitmoji character you can do stuff with Snap kit lets you use their whole camera with all their lenses I'm doing this course with Gaggen and a lot of things we talk about are inflections so what are inflections and there's a variety of styles of inflections There's technology inflections which is like basically like oh my god the internet is now in everyone's house that is an inflection There's an opportunity there or a belief inflection is like wow people really don't trust the media what can we build to help Or people are afraid to be in groups of thousands of people how can we fix that What we are seeing right now is a technology inflection or a platform inflection Platform inflection yes and this is it this is like when so Pandora the music company Tim told me that the company was around for three years and it was doing horrible And he said they heard about the Apple store for some reason Steve Jobs reached out to them and said you guys might be a good place to put your shit here And once that happened he was whoo and this I don't know if it will be but this is potentially one of those Yeah these are asymmetric bets sure maybe most of the time these platforms either don't work out or there's nothing cool to build And you'll waste you know a month of your time or you might catch a wave early and you might get to the top so for example the very first episode of this whole podcast chain is with Sui And Sui talks about he was working at Microsoft and he realized he wants to quit and go start a company he quits he moves back home with his parents for like two weeks And the first two weeks he's kind of bored and the day he quit basically Facebook did their developer conference and said hey we're making Facebook platform Anyone can build an app on Facebook now so he goes home and he's like alright I don't know if this is going to be a business I don't think so but he's like I just need to start programming again just to get the rust off And so he builds a Facebook app that was stupid it was like a superlative zap like which of your friends is most likely to end up in jail or whatever Boom goes viral you know he ends up with tens of millions of users and that changed the trajectory of his life where Silicon Valley starts calling him and you know Naval flies him out to San Francisco and wants to invest in him and shit like that So he took a bet on the sort of day the platform launched if I'm a board developer today or I'm somebody who's got you know the ability to code and you know a weekend I would be building something on top of Snapkit The thing I would build is actually so I think what's hard is when you want to build something that gets the user to leave Snapchat and come to your app so you kind of have to build something that can actually do the whole experience should just be on Snapchat And it should not compete with what Snapchat does so here's the idea.

Okay. Yeah, I call it cameo kit. Basically I think you could build the app cameo on top of Snapchat. So you would basically cameo kit would just say cool. I want to buy a Snapchat from one of these celebrities and I'll pay you right here through Snapchat and then I want to send it either to myself or to my friend on my Snapchat list so basically imagine I it's your birthday coming up right when's your birthday it's in a few days. Yeah, you actually bought me a cameo you had Gilbert Godfrey caught me a dickhead.

Right so I did that last year but but but this year I could do it through cameo kit a little new invention of mine. So basically I would go and Snapchat I would open it up. I would see a list of influencers that are that have Snapchat which is like every celebrity in the world. I would request a video and I pay right there and then you would receive a Snapchat from either from me or from them in your inbox and the whole cameo experience could be built on top of Snapchat without having to have separate websites separate apps all that stuff and you compete with cameo very So I think that's a very simple idea that could monetize on top of Snapchat.

What else what are other ideas that can monetize it I think that you I'm sure a lot of people have spotted this but you you're the one who told me about it so I'll attribute the genius to you I think that's a great idea. This is a good spot by you. What else which which one that one just now. Yes besides besides cameo kit cool idea. So okay so here's another one. So here's an idea. Well what you said about paint paint your bills is great like your utilities and like roommate stuff. Right yeah pay your rent I think is an easy one because younger people who split rent they could use Snapchat or snap cash to just do it and so that's kind of interesting I don't know exactly how much that's integrated but that could be a problem that you saw.

I think that you could if you're a food delivery company you should probably get on this because one of the little fun things I've been doing another birthday thing instead of cameos. Somebody on my birthday just sent me food via postmates because they know where I live and so they just ordered me food and just showed up my door and it just said you know like this is from this person. And I was like oh that was great that's like a $20 gift that is awesome and took them no effort and so that's my new hack I just send people postmates just for fun as gifts.

And so I think you could do something like that but here's another one. I saw a company that's called Moonshot very very fun company idea what they did was they were like hey all everybody's working from home which is cool and convenient in some ways but the one thing you really miss is the sort of camaraderie and interaction with your friends. And what tell the readers or listeners and me what can I Google to find that because I just searched Moonshot and I don't see it. Search Moonshot escape room. So what Moonshot is it's a virtual escape room that happens over zoom.

So it costs I think I think it's like 300 bucks to do the experience but it's great you know that as a team building experience a team building cost is nothing team you know companies will easily pay for that for their for groups of you know 10 to 12 employees to get together and do something. And so I do escape rooms all the time with my team I think it's really fun way to you know go out and do something. And so this is done all through zoom they built a whole experience digitally and I'm like oh this is really smart because you know escape rooms are actually pretty good businesses in general but this takes out the one biggest cost of escape rooms which is like you know the rent and the person the human being you need to like facilitate a whole escape room doing this on top of zoom is a really smart idea in my opinion.

This is great I don't know I don't know that could ever be huge but it could be good. I'm looking at it now it's what what's reason is that the company owns it. I have no idea. How did you find this. This was on product time and then it got shared because again this was sort of remarkable. People hadn't seen something like this so people started sharing it it went kind of viral. Yeah okay it's I didn't do it so here's another one in the last three months that we've been sheltered in place how many zoom birthdays have you attended.

None how do you know what oh my god I've had to do five of these things including my own. I'm only I'm only. Oh my god Sean did I miss your what was your birthday. My birthday is back in April but basically oh wait I didn't give you anything I'm sorry. It's all good. But in fact I usually hate my birthday because I hate you know believe it or not even though I have a podcast I like plaster my face everywhere in the cover art. I actually hate when the when the attention is on me and it's like this forced fun things I was actually happy to skip my birthday but over this quarantine period.

I've been to so many zoom birthday parties because people can't celebrate through the normal means now. I don't think this is going to last very long. You just have more friends than I do. Yeah well you know that's that's what I do but I don't know I don't think this will last very long but if you could find some way to do celebrations over zoom. If you could find a way to make a party. My coworkers get married on Saturday they're twitching twitch streaming. I don't know what you call the word they're streaming on twitch the wedding.

Oh nice. That's pretty good. Yeah so I don't know how long some of these last I think the the cameo on top of Snapchat and I think the escape room over zoom I think that's more here to stay I don't think the birthday stuff will last very long but I like the idea of building stuff on top of zoom and a top of Snapchat especially now that people are celebrating occasions and looking for ways to socialize remotely. I would do rent payment easy. No that's the first thing I'm going to focus on. Great idea. That's a good one.

You want to do one or two more. Sure you got one or you want me to do. Yeah I had one. Let me. Oh wait no I already I kind of like I did the Coke family and the art publishing kind of at one it kind of fell into each other. Did we talk did we do a recap of. Death. What's his name like with death. We did not do a recap. No. Yeah what do you think about that. Okay so two weeks ago or 10 days ago. We had this guy named Mike and he started liquid death.

It's bottled water. I had a lot of people hand people message up can water message us and say they think that the water was bad. Yeah yeah. And I think the idea is kind of cool. I don't I'm I like him a lot. I think that guy's a winner. I think he's a winner too and I went into the thing being like I think this idea is kind of dumb. We had talked about it before. It was kind of dumb and I came out of it being like maybe I should hit this guy up to see if I can invest in this company.

And the reason why is sometimes it really just is that simple. So he's taking a mass product like bottled water or canned water is a mass product water is the like you know the definition of a mass consumption product. Then the second thing is if you just did anything different in the water space and it latches on with any small percentage of that population you're going to have a meaningful business. And I think he's doing something very different compared to how the other brands are approaching it. And I really do think this is going to be a successful company especially once I met the guy and I was like oh this guy's a winner and he understands what this is and what it isn't.

And that makes sense to me. Yeah I would like to see how he operates. He's the type of guy who I would be a little bit nervous. I don't want to get to know him more because he seems like a guy that is a little reckless and that could be both good and bad. And that's a good call because he was talking about the previous company he built the brandy company that he built. And I think he's a great starter and he saw the opportunity. He starts it. He has a vision for the brand and what the culture wants.

Now in terms of the blocking and tackling that it takes to just operate for like seven years straight probably not the best in that other company he kind of he was kind of vague about it. He's like I parted ways with those guys. It's all good terms. You know I still have my shares. Basically it was like OK thanks. Thanks for the creativity bud. We'll take it from here. It seemed like it was kind of that. I could totally see that happening again with liquid death. A person I admire once wrote that being artistic is the exact opposite of being of making money and are basically artists and capitalists are the opposite.

And I haven't decided if I fully agree with that but I tend to I say I'm closer to agreeing with it than I am not agreeing with it and that artists are the opposite. And that doesn't mean they're good or bad. You know I think a lot of art you should who gives a fuck about the money. It's great because it's interesting. I don't care if it's expensive. And sometimes when people are artistic I think OK you're cool. I don't think that you can make a peanut like run a company that has to make and save money.

Right. Yeah I think that's probably true that you know if you have an extreme strength in one area you probably don't have the extreme strength in the exact opposite sort of skill set area. What I hope for is you have to be just good enough to be dangerous in the other area. So like OK you're super creative and you can you can build brands. You know do you have just enough of the operational know how and discipline to execute on this like you know Sophia Amaro so she when she was on she was like she's clearly a great brand builder.

She did it with Nasty gal. She did it with a girl boss. That was called to get girl boss. Well she's a marketer. She's definitely a marketer. And she and she did. I think it's I think it's a little more the marketing in the sense that it is marketing but I guess it's like to identify what's in the soul of the customer and then be able to build a product or brand that taps into that. And so I think she was doing a great job of that. I think this guy Mike is doing a great job of that.

You know with Nasty gal. She didn't manage the other side of it and you know the train went off the cliff and and so you know you have to know enough of that or you have to hire people. That that compliment it in that way. And if anybody has any wants to read something about this I just read this blog post that was called pioneers settlers and town planners or something like that. And it basically talks about like in any given company you have three types of people you have the pioneers who are going to you know they want to go breach new land.

They want to be the first ones there and live off of you know what they can hunt so they can kill and they keep. And then you have sort of the settlers who follow in right after and they start to set up you know the very basic systems for life to continue. And they're not just looking for the next thing like the pioneers are. And then you have the town planners that can organize like at large scale systems. And so none is good and bad or cool and not cool. It's just a matter of like knowing who you are or knowing where you're at as a company and then making sure you have the right type of person leading.

Based on what's needed. If you need innovation you need a pioneer. If you need operations you need more of a town planner. Coincidentally I've read this article today called managers the difference between managing and leading. And the idea was like people who are leaders are great in chaos and they don't really they're like very comfortable chaos they're very comfortable with ambiguity. And that's important and people who are managers are all about creating something sustainable that can operate each and every day effectively. And I'm for sure the leader for sure not the manager. And so I actually read something like that today so we're similar.

Yeah right on. Okay a couple other quick things that are that are kind of interesting. So I want to get your opinion on this just give me a dumb or awesome. The website is called human IPO app. These guys are doing a very fancy branding around an old idea. So what it does is I can go I can go do a human IPO. So I'm Sean I go public I get a stock ticker which is like you know SHA or whatever. And I basically IPO off a share of my time so I can auction off up to 500 hours of my time that you can book from me at a certain price.

And then if people think hey you know this Sean guy he's on you know he's on the way up. His time is going to be more valuable in the future. I'm going to buy a unit of this guy's time I can either hold it and trade it later at a higher price or I can I can I guess use it to like book an hour of my time. So this is the core on the website now it's incredibly interesting. Tell me what you think of it. For sure interesting for sure innovative and wild and whoever invented this is a nerd and I fucking love those types of people.

Logistically I just don't think it makes sense because well. So I can buy Brian's time. Well so if it was I'm looking at this right now I don't understand why they call it like they're really just rebranding just like expert networks and consulting like it's just like dude just let me have your time for it. So I think they clarity FM. It's the same thing. Definitely cool highly unlikely to work. Right. That's what I think. I think this is like an art project that's neat. This is I don't know how did you find this. I saw it on my product hunt and I was like I've been following.

I think I talked about this on one of the previous things I've been following these personal ICOs personal personal coins that people are creating in the crypto world. This is not crypto but it's the same idea. And I think it sort of has the same pros and cons. I think it's like kind of exciting in a way to like bet on people. And I think it's kind of lame in a way which is like what do I get. I get an hour of their time. No on this you have like this guy I just clicked on you have to buy a hundred hours of his time at $250 an hour.

So what does that mean to is that way is it 25 grand or 250 grand. I didn't hear exactly what you said but you have to buy a hundred hours from him at $250. So that's 25 25 grand. Yeah. So but like I don't think if I was this guy and I just sold a hundred hours of my time I have a feeling that I would bail on a lot of that. Yeah. So one one pieces are you actually going to fulfill the second is so what am I doing. It's actually basically like a freelancer selling blocks of design time or programming time or consulting hours or whatever it is.

OK. That's cool. Maybe first really special unique people that that works. I don't think this is that interesting overall. The ones I think are more interesting are the ones where you actually get a piece of their earnings over the next X years. I would never do that in a million years. I know. But some people would some people would say cool. I'll take you know it's like people who raise money for their company right. They're selling off future earnings for capital today and some people might want instead of doing it for your company you might do it for yourself.

So I think it's interesting. I want to see somebody like I'm going to sign up for this case. I'm going to I'm going to I want to do you know these guys can you introduce me. Can I be one of these people that they can I sell a hundred hours. It seems it does seem interesting. Just from like a like an like an innovation perspective like it's just so weird and interesting. I would love to I would love to try this. I like it. Cool. OK. So that was the that was the last one I wanted to do.

Do you have any other stuff you want to go over or anything else on this list. Interesting. I could talk about any of this stuff. Yes. But I don't want to talk about it today. On here you have what is happiness. And I'm I want to learn all about that. I also want to learn about Hybe which I think I know it is. But I kind of want to save it because the happiness thing looked interesting to me in that happy book. I had it pulled up on my Amazon. I am going to probably read that whole book in the next two or three days.

That is interesting. And I'll tell you why it's interesting is I'm obsessed with my posture right now because I've gotten like strong and fit over the last three months. And that's wonderful. But I have scoliosis. My like my posture is horrible and it's making me nervous because I'm like what's the point of getting strong if I'm like crooked and not healthy. And I've looked all over the place for like good scoliosis workout routines. I'm like man I just want like just something just like a posture doctor. Right. And it's kind of interesting like a like a posture doctor is kind of cool to me.

And I thought about that. I went for a run the other day and I was like I think I don't know how to run. I think nobody taught me how to run. And then I started running a certain way and then I got out of shape and I think I just run like shit. And I know I don't swim the right way or there's like a better way more efficient way to swim also. And I'm like I need to I want to clean all these up. I want to clean up running. I want to clean up by walking you know cadence or whatever you call it.

And then also my swimming. But yeah, I'm similarly obsessed with these things. And you know you've been getting jacked which I think you know props to you for doing every time you send me one of these videos. You know Sam sends me these videos that are like it's not nudes but it's definitely more than what it's like more than friends less than lovers were somewhere in between there. And he sends me the video and you've been getting jacked and it's kind of amazing. And you know so so that's you know props to you for actually doing it.

It's been a big change. I basically like just I don't I don't know if I do a diet. I just eat meat and only green vegetables and I just don't eat breakfast and I move every single day. I don't know it's it's been easy but it has been awesome. Amazing. But you know what sucks it's just sitting in a chair it totally fucks you up. And so this is why I want like a body doctor like a posture doctor like I just I want to be more like a wild animal in this in this book the happy body.

There's this picture of this like inversion chair. I don't know if you've ever done one of them. I have. Are they good. I've never done one. But when I saw it I was like well here's a thing here's a thing I'm gonna have to buy because I think I need to I think I need to do this. I think I need to wait but did they say that inversion chairs are good. Yeah. I just hang I have a bar and I just hang for my bar. Yeah but you need to go the other way you need to you need to hang from your legs and so your back decompresses.

That's what they basically say it's for is to decompress the spine. Oh I'm going to read this whole book. How long is it. I don't know it's kind of long. All right cool let's let's get out of here but now we're just talking bullshit. Cool. Thanks for listening. Share this with your friend.
