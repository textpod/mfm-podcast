Model: Whisper-small

Like yeah, if you want to if you want to pre buy Southern Sam sticky icky You need to just I don't know DM me on Twitter. Bye bye Twitter is Sean V feed DMV and say I'm in on Southern Sam sticky icky All right before we get in the episode we got to say something really quick Sean I sent you that thing to share so if you go to Sean and ore eyes Twitter profile, you'll see it or you go to rate this podcast comm Mfm it stands for my first million rate this podcast comm slash Mfm if you leave a review for us on Apple podcasts We're gonna select one person or we select in one person We're selecting six people and we're gonna give a grand to six different people and we'll announce that winner in a couple weeks we're doing this because if If we get more reviews in a very particular amount of time and you get more momentum You go up the charts and if you go up the charts you get more listeners or at least that's the hypothesis So we're incentivizing listeners.

We get more excited. We are you goes grow and I know that's what everybody wants So let's do it. Yeah, I just went to a conference today Cody Sanchez conference to talk and Dude everyone listens. It's pretty fun. How was how was the conference? She has her brand is like contrarian contrarian capital. I think it is And so this was the country in conference or something like that Yeah, and I love her and I love the conference, but I it was kind of silly like in my head I was making a joke because they had contrarian Merch and they had like hundreds of the same ones and I was like well, we all bought this like that's You know, I didn't really work that you know what I mean like So anyway, it was great though.

No, she was cool. I asked I think there was probably 300 people I asked to listen and I felt like everyone all their hands went up people were talking about us They always confuse our voices, but we get that all the time All right, I love it and I was supposed to go to that. I didn't go you went There's like a bunch of different motivations people have for going to these things What was your motivation because some people would say I'll go into these conferences kind of a waste of time and Other people say no, I love it.

I'm network. I learned things. I just want because she's she's my friend and it's near my house And then in general but you've gone to some of some of the some other ones like this like the podcast one you went to recently Or stuff in New York what I guess give people give people how you think about this stuff Because I think it's good to have like a frame of like, okay This is why I go to these is how I go to them and this is what what's come out of it for me Um, I like meeting people who I know on the internet that makes me feel good And I also like going, you know, I've paid money to go to some events.

I've paid five thousand ten thousand dollars go to some events Um, because I can meet one person and become a lifelong friend with them and that pays for itself But makes me happy. So yeah, I don't mind going Yeah, I do the same thing. I kind of have in my head I'm here to learn one thing like I want to have one great idea like a truly great idea Maybe it's a tactic a marketing idea a realization of something I need to change or a new business idea a new whatever So one great idea is my like bar and then one great person if I do that it's worth it.

That's like such a low bar But yeah, but what's better? What like the best the good part about that is then you go hunting you you're saying I'm here to meet one great person Who's a great person and if you're talking to somebody who's not that great You're like, all right peace out. I'm gonna go bump around and see who else is here, right? And same thing with one great idea You can listen to a talk and you might otherwise kind of zone out or say oh this doesn't apply to me But if you're just on the hunt for that golden nugget the one great idea and it's like dude in the eight hours of this event There's gonna be at least one great idea It changes the way for me at least it changes the way I I intend these things Yeah, I agree.

I'm the same way and speaking of great ideas Do we I want to talk to me about let's go to these three new stories that you want to go over because I actually Yeah, I think you selected all three and they're awesome. They're awesome. All three are pretty good So all right, so I have three you have one let's start with yours. You have one that's about Elon tweeting about the Elon tweeted something about giving away Six billion to world hunger that what I heard was you tell me if this is correct my wife told me this story She goes do you hear it? You know somebody tweeted out or there's a new story that said, you know these billionaires the elons the richest man in the world now If he you know with six billion dollars He could end world hunger and then he replied to it He was like if you could show me that six billion dollars would end world hunger I'll write to check now like I will happily do it.

Just show me that that's the case and So that's all I know about this. What did you oh, you don't know what happened after that? Okay, so Someone I forget who maybe CNN said if the billionaires would donate six billion dollars We'd cure or end world hunger Elon like you said replied and goes and his language was great He goes show me how that will happen and I will sell Tesla stock right now to pay for six billion dollars of this stuff And I forget the exact title but something like the head of you United was it world hunger or United Nations some like official International body the head said, you know better yet You know Elon just come and we'll show you our processes and how we work and Elon said no sunshine is great Tell me in tweet form how this is gonna help and where the money will go and I will send you the money right now and he goes, you know, this is just too complicated to say over Twitter and I think and I'm not like the biggest Elon nut hugger.

I think that this totally made a lot look great These types of things should be done in a very simple way where you can explain what's happening You don't have to say like You know exactly but you could say like, you know, 30% of the budget is gonna go to hire around 10,000 people who we think Can give out this much, you know, whatever that is a good enough answer and The guy didn't do it total miss and when we were talking to big cloud guy now Natter a few days ago He was explaining what he does and then you go no, no, no, no, no This is what you do and you explained it so much better and he goes, oh, that's how I should always explain it Everyone should have that skill that you have and you could actually develop that skill.

It is a skill It's not just a talent and anyway, this guy blew it and I thought it was an awesome tweet thread You know, so two things one is on that skill. So how do you develop that? I'll give you two kind of unorthodox ways that you develop it. The first is you got to have Bullshit callers around you. So like, you know the way I was like, no, no, no, dude, that's way too complicated Most people just won't say that to somebody and there's this great clip I know you like you watch some Joe Rogan as well as I do and this is a great clip of Brian Callan Who's one of the kind of friends and the crew of Joe Rogan and they're doing their fight companion podcast Which is where they just watch the fight and they're just shooting the shit drinking and eating cheese and they drink a wine eating cheese and they watch the fight and like, I don't know 100,000 or more people will tune in to like hang out with them while they watch the fight even though the fight's not visible on the screen That's just how fun it is to hang out and during this thing Brian Callan who's a lifelong, you know The comedian he's kind of like a scrawny guy and Joe's kind of like a former martial artist He's sort of like a meathead and the other guy on there is an ex pro fighter so a bunch of kind of like bros and A Brian is saying something he goes he Brian's like oh man if somebody ever tried that on me, bro You know I would you know what I would do and they were like And they just kind of moved on for a second and then he's like and the guy said it again Like nobody really addressed it and he's like he's like I can't he's like I would never let somebody it would be it would be on and Then it was like right.

What are you talking about? He's like, well, why are you saying shit like this? He's like, you know, you don't you're not gonna do anything first of all And he's like he's like the problem Brian is that you hang out with people? That will let you say shit like this and he's like you need to stop hanging out with whoever type of people Let you let you get away with just saying things like this and just you know letting it fly and After that I just thought that was hilarious and then I started noticing Oh, there's some people in my life and I call them, you know the people who will tell you there's food in your teeth It's like There's two types of people there's people who will see it and not say anything and then you know four hours later You get home and you're like, bro, what the hell I had spinach in my teeth the whole time Why didn't someone tell me and then there's the person who will cut you off a bit? Yeah, you know, you got a little something in your teeth here and you're like, oh shit I'm embarrassed but like the embarrassment was localized to the moment and then you like saved yourself from there That's a true friend and so you want people around you that will tell you when you're saying something that just makes no sense Or is confusing or is like delusional or whatever and they're just like, what are you talking about? Why are you saying that you say stuff like this all the time? This doesn't make any sense or you say stuff like this and honestly I think you think that's really awesome, but no one other people hear that they don't hear really awesome like we asked to Bray you have that a brain who used to work for us and we love he was explaining to Sean and I what his new business does and He wrote this long paragraph and I think Sean goes I don't know what any of those words you just said mean and then he was like I Buy can't I buy land but before paying for it.

I hurry up and resell it to someone else and make a profit It's like, okay great. Yeah, I just say what that means, right? Yeah, well actually the first thing he said was bro I just wrote you two paragraphs and I didn't even have to address it because he knows If you wrote two paragraphs, and I don't know what you what I don't know what you do still that's on you That's not on beat And so, you know the boat the burdens on the owner So one thing is having people like that around you the other thing is hang out with somebody who's good at it And maybe you know hopefully for some people listening to this podcast helps them because I think we'd both do a good job of explaining Stuff without too much jargon or you try at least and so the more you hang out with people like that You'll just naturally through osmosis like you know this it'll just pick up.

It'll be like a sponge It'll just come right into you You'll just start getting better at it because you've heard our voices in your head all the time And so hang out with people who do it like I have a buddy Sully who's great at this you're really great at this Ramon's really great at this so like our best friends all are really good at just Saying things for what they are in a way that's simple and easy and fun to understand and like so then you by Nate You know you'll naturally get good at it speaking of friends What uh what it so I was out to dinner with Moise the other day and he made this comment about Casper He ends up tweeting it pretty brilliant.

You want to talk about that? I do it. Can I say one thing about the Elon? Yeah, so so the guy from world hunger who's like, oh It's not that simple. I can't really break it down. All right So that's obviously a loss on there And but there is a great example of a charity who does this well So have you seen what charity water does for their like accountability? Because what you Elon said was the whole thing I'll donate the money My only thing is it has to be kind of like open source and transparently accountable Money is going and what's the effect of it Jack Dorsey did that as well And he just Jack Dorsey did it with a fucking Google spreadsheet, right? Yeah.

Yeah, he said here's the here's all the money Here's where it's going. Here's the schedule and here's it's a Google doc It's a Google doctor anybody can go view and you can't edit it But you can go view it at any given time and see how the money is amazing So so the founder of cherry water he his story is amazing But like I'll give you kind of the the fast forwarded version of it So fast forwarded version of his stories guy named Scott Harrison he He grows up and when he's a kid his mom got this like Terrible illness she basically she was a stay at home mom So the dad goes to work kids go to school She stayed home and the new house they had moved into it had like a gas leak or something like that And so it like silently killed her autoimmune system So she got so her immune system was so compromised that she could not like go outside She could not like touch objects that had not been sanitized She couldn't do the laundry because like the cleaner the bleach had chemicals in it And it would just like kill her if you know You know had to like do everything by hand using baking soda six times or like if she wanted to read a book Scott would go put it in the oven first and they would have to sort of like kill all the bacteria like by Sanitizing it with heat and then handed to her and she'd wear gloves and they would like slowly turn pages and stuff like that like it was insane and so he and And then but even that whole time they didn't sue the company that had that was responsible for the leak because they were like very Religious family and they were like you know this is God's plan and so Scott who like grows up with this really unusual Childhood he's having to like in many ways be the caretaker of the household because his mom wasn't able to do it He sees his mom suffering.

He's like dude, you know eff this religion shit. I'm I'm gonna go live now So he gets turns 18 and he like goes to college, but I think I think he might have dropped out Not a hundred percent sure, but he he starts parting like crazy. He moved to New York And he becomes like a guy in the party scene and Scott if you've ever seen him He's a good looking guy. He's sort of like a George Clooney looking motherfucker Like he's like very like it's like guy gets gray hair and he looks even him more handsome than he did before and so Rico suave type of guy very suave Super great storyteller very funny.

Just he's a great hang like I've hung out with him and you're just like charmed You know the whole time and so anyways He hits the party scene and he eventually because he's like all right I got to make some money so it becomes a party like promoter So his job was and he says this like my job was to convince rich guys that they needed to pay me like $5,000 $6,000 to get to go buy this hundred dollar bottle of alcohol And he's like they knew what they were doing and I knew what I was doing and it worked anyways And so he starts making a killing as a party promoter and he's got the fancy watch.

He's got the model girlfriends He's got the nice penthouse in New York and he's getting paid, you know, whatever some vodka company will pay him $2,500 a night just to be drinking their liquor instead of somebody else's liquor and somebody will pay him to wear this watch instead of somebody else's Watch and so he's kind of the man in this scene but a few years go by and he's like Starts to feel you know as you do when you kind of get in this party lifestyle He's first feel a little empty inside like the the highs no longer are doing it for you anymore And I think he was the story is he was on this guy's boat this guy his name is What's the name guy the guy who created Cirque du Soleil like guy? Canadian guy yeah, some name like that.

I can't remember off top my head billionaire Canadian Yeah, he's always yacht or boat or whatever party boat And Scott's just so in the boat like in the room where he was in there's a Bible and he kind of sees it And he grew up in a super religious household and then has you know become basically like a sinner And he just sort of picks up the book and you know, he's hung over one day and he starts reading it He's reading the Bible and he starts to like kind of like get emotional And he sort of has this literal like come to Jesus moment where he's like what am I doing with my life like you know like I'm not a good person.

I'm not doing good for anyone in the world and like, you know, I'm just like partying and drinking It's all a very shallow lifestyle. It's like, you know These these hot girls and then these rich guys and this like lifestyle. That's not great in drugs alcohol that sort of thing So he's like, okay, and I think also he literally woke up that day and he was like numb in his hand He's like this is like a metaphor. I'm not just numb in my arm like I'm numb in life right now So he's like, okay, here's what I'm gonna do.

I'm gonna take the next six months I'm just gonna take a six month break from this lifestyle and I'm just gonna what's like the most Servant like servant thing I can go do. How can I just serve people? you know, how can I go do a very Christian thing here and And so he applies to all these nonprofits and they reject him They're like, you're a party promoter like we don't he's like dude, I'll work for free and they're like, no We don't need you you're kind here. He's like, are you sure like I'm good with people.

I'm good with like events I'm good with all this stuff and they're like, no, no, no, like where you come from. That's not that's not what we're looking for here So he gets rejected after one after another and finally he gets this one group to agree to let him work there if he pays So he had to pay to go work there. So he basically made a large contribution to Mercy ships, I think is what it's called. It's basically a thing where Hotshot doctors in the US like for one week out of the year They go on this boat and it goes to Africa and then they they spend all week there doing like pro bono surgeries on People who need surgeries and then they come back and he's like he kind of his back on his photography So he's like, oh dude, I'll I'll take photos of this trip That'll be my contribution and so he goes there and he's got the photos still he'll show it to you And when he gives his talk he shows them.

It's like what they were doing was there was kids with like Massive like tumor growth. So like, you know, they would have like a huge lump on the side of their head Like the size of a volleyball or like in their jaw Their jaw would be protruding out like six inches because they had this growth and like all they needed was just for it to be removed Like they're having trouble eating breathing. It's like not even a cancerous thing It's just a benign tumor, but this needed it removed and he's like dude the line was like a mile long He's like the saddest part is we You know, we couldn't do all the certain though The one week was up and there's still people in the end of the line that didn't get their surgeries or whatever So he's like, okay I'm not just gonna do this.

I'm just gonna like I'm gonna go back I'm gonna dedicate my life to like, you know Helping people because I can't believe what I've been doing and this was so meaningful to me and whatever So he's like first he does two things he goes to on the ground in Africa And he says what is the like root cause? What are some of the root causes of this problem? So he does kind of what Elon calls first principles thinking Which is why does this person have this crazy tumor in the first place? It's like well, they might have this tumor because You know, they are are they don't have clean drinking water and sanitation and so there's like highly infested things So you found that on all these different axes like why are these women? Why are women, you know following so far behind in society and not getting high paying jobs? Well because they actually have to spend five hours a day just walking to the nearest waterhole and walking back carrying this 40 pound 50 pound jug of water and that takes five hours in a day and then then they have to use that water quickly And they do all the laundry cooking washing of their kids and then like they don't work and then because of that They're like, you know stuck and economically stuck.

So anyways, he's I he identifies waters the root cause he's like, okay He asked himself a very important question. He goes Why have I not been giving to charity? Like I kind of knew there's suffering all around the world kids in Africa are starving and need water and all this Why didn't I give and it's a this is the connection to the Elon thing He's like because I always kind of felt and heard like you never know where the money goes or if you gave if you gave Even if you do give money You have this worry like I don't know if this is even making an impact and they never closed the loop So you never knew where the money went and you never saw the impact of your dollars.

It was just like, thank you. Goodbye Here's your tax. Here's your tax deduction. Goodbye. And so he's like, all right I'm gonna do it differently. He's like, he's like, I he didn't know anything about the nonprofit space He's like, all right, like let's just do the basics. He's like, what if 100% of the money went to the cause? He's like that would like clear up that question mark He's like and then he's like also I'm a photographer like why don't we just take photos of the place where we do the project and send It to the person who gave us the money like if you contributed we know where the project is Why don't we just send you a photo when we do the project say hey, here's what you what you did? And so he's like I'm gonna use GPS trackers and photos to make people feel the effect of their giving and that's what he does now That's what he does now So he goes back to New York He throws a party because he's like as for kind of the only thing I know how to do if he's like I'm throw a party It's my birth 30th 30th birthday or something like that He's like throw a birthday party but instead of giving me a gift at the door charge I just want you to give $30 to the cause I'm 30 years old give 30 bucks to the cause and so people come they have this party because he's got a great social network in New York and You know they forget about it three months later.

He sent them all photos of the project that they contributed to he's like Hey, that that all added up. We drilled these two water wells. They used to have to walk this far now here's how far they walk look at the map and You know we turned a four hour walk into a 20 you know into a 10 minute walk and then he's like Here's what the women have to say there's videos of them thanking you and here's like the kids You know here's the water like fresh clean. This is the water. They used to drink.

It's like dirty Here's the clean clear water. That's what you did and people were blown away and that became They've raised a ton of money like 400 500 million dollars Yeah, well the story gets a little crazier So he's like I'm gonna stick to this hundred percent model hundred percent money goes to the cause and people like well Bro, there's a reason people don't do that Like how are you gonna pay for your own salary or the salary of anybody working on the charity? He's like we'll do a separate bank account literally two bank accounts one That's public donations that go to the cause and one that'll be private donations for people that want to fund our charity to do this And he's like and of course people are pretty interested in doing the hundred percent thing less people were to the private thing And that's where like kind of full circle I guess like I don't know how long I want to go on this but I'll give you the kind of the cool the cool last bit So he's basically running out of money For the private side for the actual for himself and he's asleep on couches And he's like, you know, I got a backpack to my name and like I'm the only employee so it's fine And but even still he starts running out of money his friends are kind of kicking him off couches He's running out of friends houses to go sleep in and he's like alright He's like let me just do what like this whole thing may end But I want to do as much good as I can in the meantime So he's like, you know this birthday idea of giving up your birthday like we're all pretty privileged.

We don't need birthday gifts I gave up my birthday. That's how I started this charity like instead of giving to me give to them He's like dude, there's these social networks now Facebook MySpace Bebo that they all have like millions of people and they all have this birthday feature And people go right on each other's wall. He's like so he wrote a letter to Mark Zuckerberg To like Tom from MySpace and to Michael Burch from Bebo and he wrote a letter to all of them He said hey, you have millions and millions of members on your platforms They all have birthdays log registered in the platform and people looking up for a way to wish each other It would be amazing if you added a charity button away for you to give up your birthday and let people donate for your birthday to the cause He gets no reply from Facebook.

He gets no reply from MySpace and he gets no reply from Bebo So he's like, ah, whatever didn't work now a month later Michael Burch from Bebo says hey Scott. Sorry. I missed this We actually just sold the company. So he just sold the company for $850 million and he said, you know So I can't really implement this here, but you know what? I'm in New York Let's just meet up for an hour and so he goes and he meets with them Scott gives him the full pitch Michael's like a British guy. He's pretty reserved, you know in person He's you know, British people have like a dry sense of humor too So they're not like the most like emotive when you're talking to them and so Scott basically see it That feels like oh, I told this guy what we're doing.

He basically didn't flinch and he moved on like whatever and He had six weeks of runway left in the bank. He's like, oh, that was my last That was my Hail Mary. I have six months six weeks of runway left and then this whole thing ends But you know what we did some good work and then Michael wrote him an email right after the meeting like at the next day And he just said hey Scott loved her chat Send me your wire instructions. I'll send you a million dollars use it. However you wish keep rocking The million dollars kept them going for one more year and then since then they've now raised Hundreds of millions of dollars for the charity They're like one of the biggest privately backed charities because they have this hundred percent model and Michael got them in with other kind of Wealthy tech people and they all like this idea of like accountability Transparency and closing the loop on on giving and feeling the impact like that just feels right to the kind of the new new wave of rich People and so it's like taken off since then that's the crazy story of charity water That you just gave them a 30 minute infomercial Yeah, I don't feel bad.

I've been with them to Africa and literally it's like It's not only like changing lives But when when he goes there people literally and he's the most humble dude, but I went to the village and people literally feel like he's Jesus a because it's like a white man who comes to this village is like the only white person ever like in the village and B because he like whatever he's doing when he leaves here Somehow results in fresh water being like given to our village and they're like thank you whatever you're doing out there is You know God's work.

That's badass. I should I should give to him. I have not but I after that pitch I will Can I let me tell you about someone interesting? Have you heard of a guy named a J Patel? I bet you haven't never heard of him. What is it? All right You have not heard of him and you're gonna be surprised that you've not heard of him So this guy is way low key and I got interested in the space because I've been a lot really interested in low sugar products Whenever like whenever I'm in New York or particularly New York because I go to like corner stores all the time you see like Moms with the kids and they buy like Hawaiian punch or like fucking Gatorade like you sugar factory a corner store and a grocery store are sugar factories It's sad and I feel horrible.

That's a reason maybe yeah It's horrible and it's because maybe that's just more convenient, but and people just try don't think no better So I've been doing research and I found this guy named a J Patel. So listen to what this guy's done So he started a this he's only 32 So he started this thing called smooth Viking which was a men's grooming business that he sold that he started in Insta naturals, which is a net net natural based skin care Business it did 55 million dollars in 2018 And it's been I mean it crushes it and then he started Zen wise Which was a plant powered vitamins and supplements and it was doing okay like five to eight million dollars in revenue But then he was like the thing about vitamins like people are a lot of people are asking me for vitamins for my pet for Their dogs for their cats and he was like that's cool And it's even cooler because you have no idea if it works, right? That's the funny thing about pet stuff and and I give my pet vitamins and I'm like it doesn't work I have no fucking idea right, but I'm doing it and so he starts this thing called zesty Paul's and Zesty Paul's is kind of amazing and so he kind of creates a strategy where he does two things The first thing that he does is he spends a lot of money up front.

I'm making the brand really good You know a lot of guys a lot of times guys like you and me will just kind of throw something up there Yeah, like an MVP right the minimum viable product kind of looks shitty and crappy at the beginning Yeah, so he hires a Agency or a branding agency and they help him make zesty Paul's like it look really great And then he the his whole goal is to first dominate Amazon then go to retail And I was doing some research and I used jungle scout and I also watched a bunch of videos So zesty Paul's recently sold for 610 million dollars.

It's estimated on Amazon They're doing around 800. Sorry eight million dollars a month on Amazon only and then probably another seven million Through their retail outlets it costs around eight dollars to wholesale and it sells for twenty six dollars So it they could have been doing around forty million dollars in profit when they sold and they sold for six hundred and four Ten million dollars now the reason I'm bringing this up his new thing. It's called high key cookie It's and I've noticed that when you look up high key co founder, they'll They don't mention his name.

He's trying to hide it for some reason. I don't know why he's trying to hide I don't know what his deal is. He just prefers being low key But he didn't talk about it too much. I think he just prefer being low key But high key is basically low sugar cookies and he's doing the exact same thing where he's getting on Amazon and he's ranking And he's got 60,000 reviews and it's a pretty new product already. It's pretty amazing what this guy's doing He's doing the same strategy over and over and over again. Are you looking at high key cookies on? I'm on his his LinkedIn right now, so he's listed as the co CEO and He looks like he's in Florida.

How did you hear about this person? I Two different ways. I was researching Low carb cookies because I'm fascinated by that right now some current obsessions are low sugar cookies and low sugar ketchup and other sauces Right and I was researching and I saw a high key and I remember a friend our mutual friend Told me about this guy who had this thing called zesty pause and his whole strategy was to dominate Amazon and then go to retail Wow Very impressive very few people have done what this person has done. So I think he's 32 years old or 31 Yeah, that's pretty impressive.

Have you tried fat snacks? So I'm I have a list of lists here of companies that are interesting and I did try fat snacks I thought that they were fine. I thought they're okay, but the problem that I have there So I eat quest all the time. Are you familiar with quest bars? Yeah, I Like the quest chips because I'm a chip guy. I don't have a sweet tooth but the quest do they basically have like a version of Doritos and honestly, they're like the only keto snack that I actually Like I'm like it like actually replaces the craving, you know Yeah, so I eat a ton of quests now, but there's like a big background here So how do you say is it that last name Tom bill you he spoke at our event hustle kind is pretty cool guy This was actually one of the first D to C kind of home run.

So basically they bootstrapped this company and within five years sold it for a billion dollars and They were making it I think Tom's mom or someone in his family was really overweight and he wanted to create a low Glide glycegen food, you know lower carb food for his overweight family member And he's like I just needed to taste good so we can replace candy And so he creates this thing and revenues doubling like every month that eventually they sell it For a billion dollars when they get to a hundred million in revenue, but there's a it's quite controversial So I eat them but a lot of people don't like it because it has sucralose or is that how you pronounce it? So yeah, that's right, and it's basically Like a sugar alcohol and they also put a lot of fiber in it And so their protein a lot of people don't like it because it's like not the best protein It also has palm oil a lot of people don't like palm oil So a lot of like health nuts including Justin mayors who I talked to about this They they don't like it because it just kind of got some shit in there, but frankly, I love it but the reason why Quest bars are amazing is because they are in every fucking store if you go to a 711 or a gas station They are gonna have quest bars right whereas a lot of the other stuff the reason why I don't consume as much as they're not They're just not convenient right and so anyway I'm getting incredibly fascinated with these low sugar products that are in every store Well, I like the idea of the low sugar sauces I think low sugar ketchup is a great one to go after who's doing that is that a is that a business? That's like saturated or no, it's not so that's a great idea I think it's fantastic and the reason why it's fantastic is when you're trying to eat lower carb and eat healthy Mustard has no calories and no sugar in it barbecue sauce is shit ketchup very high sugar, you know if Heinz Heinz has a 45 billion dollar market cap They make something like 7 billion dollars a year just in sauces and condiments most of its light is basically ketchup And ketchup is crazy high sugar their ketchup the reason why it's that bright red is there's a ton of a ton of sugar in it and there was a company called primal kitchen which sold for 300 million dollars in 2018 It was started by this guy who kind of looks like an old version of me his name's mark What's his name mark sys and I think his name you'll have to look up mark sys and s I SS Oh, and I believe that's his name and he had a whole line dude It does look like an older version of you.

That's hilarious. Yeah, he looks like he is ripped this guy I don't know how old he is. He looks like he's like 70s 60s. Yeah, and he is like absolutely shredded, which is impressive Well, I meant his face. We kind of like similar faces, but older This is you man. This is gonna be amazing. Wow, you're gonna look like this So he's 68 years old Wow crazy and so he had this This business where he had a blog he's been a blogger forever a health blogger and he created primal kitchen, which is a They make dressings dude the dressings and ketchup are the worst dressings have so much like an Italian dressing so much fucking sugar I'm eating a salad.

It's like how's the salad like 1200 calories because the dressing So I've been like super curious about this and tell me what you think about this The problem with a lot of D to C companies is that the cost to acquire a customer is stupidly high Right now, it's I think it's the highest it's ever been At least the highest it's ever been. Yeah, correct. But particularly with the Facebook change and competition. It's just getting high So our friend Andrew created this thing where basically he he this was illegal what he did But like whatever it happened he he created a menu and put it on Uber Eats and was just like making low glycemic Muffins so I guess like almond flour muffins at home and putting it on Uber Eats and he just like made the branding really cute Could you just create like one of these high key or these low carb cookies or something like that and just put it on The local Uber Eats start getting customers put like a coupon code in there I mean, I feel like that's an interesting way to kind of hack customer acquisition for a lot of these D to C things Yeah, I think that is kind of interesting.

Although. I don't know how many people are gonna like order just Like even a bakery. It's like, okay. Yeah, you're getting like, you know a dozen muffins or cookies or whatever Like I don't know if people would just go order Like a sauce No, I don't think they would do cookies, but have you heard of insomnia cookies? It's only illegal because he just didn't have a commercial Commercial kitchen and the license right but like you could easily do that right you could do the same exact thing He if you're just if you're not doing it out of you know, like a home kitchen or whatever You just need a permit right? That's the only problem with it.

Yes, correct. Have you heard of insomnia cookies? Yeah, they're insane. Yeah, they're insane. They're amazing. I'm just thinking like I think you could do that from a cloud kitchen And then start selling them online. I Totally think you do that crumble is also like growing like crazy right now I think it's one of the fastest growing franchises is crumble cookies But let's get back to this catch up idea. How do I convince you to start this company because you would crush it It's in your area of expertise It's a beautiful market because huge like huge demand And it's a consumable so you run out and you have to keep rebuying replenishing And people use a lot of sauce and you could turn this into a whole you could extend into other sauces But if you'd start with you know ranch or you start with ketchup You'd get like a huge number of people barbecue sauce like just two three skews You could do this and then with your marketing prowess like you could build You could literally build like a 500 million dollar company for this in like four years.

I think it's amazing It's very interesting to me. I should the other day. I went to the store and I bought ketchup The other day I went to the store and I bought ketchup and it was it was like a how I didn't realize it was near Halloween And they called it blood tomato and I thought that meant like oh like it's like a some weird category where it's only Tomatoes and no sugar and I bought it and it was just normal Heinz and I've been eating this shit all week I don't want to throw it away And it's horrible the sugar and Heinz is it makes it taste good But what are we gonna call it? So Sam sauce? What do we call in what do we call in the the brand here? Oh fuck southern Sam sticky icky.

Yes Dude, yes, there we go. Oh my god, dude southern Sam is such a good I'm not joking like okay. I'm just gonna use you as the face of this. I'll build the brand I'll do all the work maybe and actually This is an incredible You like southern Sam sticky icky like yeah, if you want to Prebuy southern Sam sticky icky you need to just I don't know DM me on twitter Why have I twitter is Sean VP DM me and say I'm in on southern Sam sticky icky, which is this first sauce that's coming out And it's gonna be a I mean you're a fitness influencer.

So you got to have That balance you're gonna have the health aspect. We know that we've seen the body We've seen the videos what we need now is that flavor But southern Sam He's been this is what you needed back when you had your hot dog stand. You just needed the condiments You just need it's a it's a full circle. Oh my god. I love it. Have you heard of sir Kensington ketchup? Yes, my buddy our buddy invested in it. Who? Oh, okay, great. It's sold for a hundred and forty million dollars. Yeah, and I think it undersold It's old pretty, you know, it's sold early on.

Yeah, but I think at that time also like I think selling helped them get into retail in a big way And you know, that's one of the good things about selling these companies is like if you could do the branding You can do the cult online following. You can do the D to C online marketing side You actually almost want to leave some dry powder For the acquirer. You want to go to the acquirer and say, yeah, we're doing amazing And we have we don't even know how to do retail. You guys know that right? You guys know you got a buddy you play golf with Who does target who does uh, I guess safeways nationwide on the you know, you have the The guy in the Rocky mountain region for Whole Foods.

He's he's your ex frat buddy. Oh fantastic Like you should just buy this and then boom you already have your growth story baked in of how you're gonna improve this And so that actually helps you sell the companies to have that dry powder of sure What can the acquirer do? They don't want to see a lemon that's just been squeezed all the way all the juices out because then it's all priced in Dude, maybe I'll go to the store like right for this. Just go buy a bunch of organic and low sugar catchups and see what's out there Like I'll be the first to admit the sugar in there makes it taste so good I mean, I'll just eat ketchup with a spoon.

That's just so good. This is the idea. Okay. Okay. Okay. I got full So last episode it was like, uh, what can we do with this marketing budget? That will like make for a good story beyond just you know direct response ads This is what we should do with the marketing budget We should be launce showing it would do case studies basically do a fully open business Basically, we should show how we would build this business from scratch and southern sam's southern sam's secret sauce is gonna be the first place that we start We take we take 10 grand we take 10 15 grand And we put that instead of going and saying hey listen to our podcast We actually just tell the story of how we're building this on the podcast and that will make people want it to an end They'll see the growth and they'll see the success story Which is ultimately what this podcast about brain storming great ideas and then talking about how you bring how you would bring them to life It's definitely interesting.

I think it'd be fun. I got to go to the store though and buy a bunch of them and see what they're about I didn't see if they taste good, but uh, this primal kitchen one seems incredibly interesting I and I would imagine that these I bet the the multiples for selling these I would imagine they'd be all right, right? They'd be pretty good because The repeat purchase rate on catch up is crazy high. I'd have to imagine Yeah, I think you can safely sell for you know somewhere between two and four x revenue Depending on what your story is so how fast you're growing how big that market is, you know, etc.

But I think to even up to five times revenue is possible for a brand like this, but Well, then let me go on off a couple of data points. Maybe those were outliers that I know about. I'm not sure Yeah, I got I'll go do some research. I'm gonna figure out. I'm gonna I'm going after the big catch up Yeah, exactly. We're going after big red And we're going after we're going after big sugar I also think maybe maybe a gum line. How about gum you like gum? You have a most gum most gum is sugar free.

You know, it's like the best sugar free gum is better than sugar free I don't know. We have to go to the next level. We have to be like xylitol free or you know, try it. You remember try didn't remember how You remember how try it is like dentists recommended that's been sugar free Yeah, well, we are all recommended. We're southern recommend it choose gum if anything you're gonna do gum with caffeine in it There's this guy named now. We're just guy named Nick Simmons. He's got this business called run gum and it's gum with caffeine in it Company Lucy doing isn't that what it is? Yeah, so I invested in a nicotine gum company.

I think it's only doing okay I love nicotine though. I I I see here. Let me show you what I have in my pocket right now Can you see this I see it's a little fuzzy, but I see like a vial of some kind. What is that? It's nicotine lozenges It's like a cough drop You just put it in your lip and you just kind of suck on it. I love nicotine, man. Is that the same thing as a pouch? Is it well, no, there's no tobacco. There's no tobacco. It's just it's literally just like a mint It's like a mint that has nicotine that does what why do you do that to stop to quit smoking or to give you a buzz? Yeah, so like I like cigars and so if I could I would smoke cigars all day and so now I can go like two three weeks without a cigar and I just like Sucking on these things I feel like nicotine does have a lot of interesting advantages and I don't I don't know if nicotine is inherently bad for you in itself I know that the tobacco is so I bumped into this guy on twitter and go to Um go to it's oklahoma or just just google oklahoma smokes.

Have you heard of this brand? No, but I love it So oklahoma smokes almost like a sister brand to southern sam sticky icky, but uh oklahoma So this guy was like, oh, yeah, I have this uh like agency And we were doing kind of like branding for other products and then we launched our own product oklahoma smokes and it's basically it's an alternative Uh thing you could smoke it's like an alternative cigarette And it's got no nicotine and no tobacco, but it's got the form factor of a cigarette So you light it up you smoke it you puff it out whatever and um And it's doing really well.

So he's got like a good amount of traction and I was like wow, uh, that's great like, you know, what's uh And so I looked him up in the kind of like ad library and I was like dude, I don't see any ads he goes oh, yeah, you can't advertise for this on uh Facebook or like pretty much any ad network because they don't want you advertising cigarettes even though this is like a it's nicotine free tobacco free and um He's like so it's all just organic like tick tock Basically people just post about it on tick tock and it goes like kind of viral on tick tock and that's where all the growth comes from It's just people organically talking about it on tick tock And I'll do they have a slick website The website is very nice.

The branding is great. Um The whole thing is really well done. Um, and I like it a lot. So, you know, maybe we'll go on the smokes Maybe we'll we work with their agency for uh for our brand. Well, all right. We got who they use it's all coming together They are the agency That's what they were doing for this. Are they based in Oklahoma? No, I think it's just a brand like the dude was like just like some Indian dude Although I'm an Indian dude. I was born in Oklahoma. So I guess I guess maybe they do have some Oklahoma roots I'm not sure but I think it's a lot more like what do they live? Isn't this just like isn't that an amazing brand name? Amazing.

Oklahoma smoke just sounds like a band I want to wear an Oklahoma. Sounds like everything I want to be a part of Yes, Oklahoma smokes. Oh, that's phenomenal. That's a brilliant name. Right. Like if that was my nick name, you know, I'd be a happy man. So And they're doing they here's the dude look at this company. They're doing no nick november. So no nicotine november Uh, and they're giving a discounts. Um, no sauce september, baby No sauce This is good. I like these guys. Where do they live? Do you know? Uh, I have no idea.

I don't even know if you wanted me to shout it out. Everybody's probably happy with it But I've never tried it. I don't smoke. So it's like not a product. I would use I just thought the branding was extremely well done And so I kind of added it to my swipe file of like, oh, this is this is a great name and a great brand here And uh, really cool product idea challenging, you know, it's it's doing well, but it's not huge because Very hard to grow very hard to market something like this. Um through traditional channels.

So I don't know what they're gonna do Uh, you know, hopefully this gives them a little spike or whatever, but uh, you know, I think that's the hard part about a business like that Do you want to do one more? Um, yeah, let's do one more. Do you have one or you want me to to pick one here? You we didn't do our news thing. I kind of hijacked the long ass chris harrison. It's not harrison story. Pick one of the two Uh, let's do the zillo thing. So So the funny story about this zillo thing says zillo came out And they said hey, we are shutting down our ibuyer business, which is basically where they would just Uh, you want to sell your home? Boom.

We'll give you an instant offer our algorithm will do a calculation and spit out a price You don't have to go through a broker. You don't have to stage your house You don't have to do like three months of showings like we'll just give you an offer today You can sell your home today and the idea was this was you know, sort of an idea they stole from open door So open door was a startup that was built to do just exactly this instantaneous Say like instant sales of houses And zillo saw open door growing and value and now open doors public And they created a couple years ago their own in house like competitor.

They really copied that feature But it didn't work. So they got stuck. They just came out and announced. Hey, we lost 500 million dollars this quarter. Oops We're gonna lay off 25 of our staff And we have 7 000 homes that we need to unload because we're getting out of this business And they're getting a point eight billion dollars. They're getting out of it because they also are getting criticized constantly because Zillow is what everyone uses to Get comps for homes and if the person also buys them you could easily manipulate the price of things so if you they can buy a home in one neighborhood knowing that it's going to increase the A lot of different things so and it's competitive with their core business.

So they're Which I give them credit for because most companies they wouldn't do it for all these reasons We're mentioning right now. They would just stay out and they would get disrupted zillow tried It's not get disrupted to try to add this feature But like their core business is basically Selling to agents right for consumers. They give you price information and it's supposed to be a trusted source So that's one challenge. The other conflict was The main business is agents buying leads from from zillow and if zillow is the buyer Then they don't need the agents.

They are their own agent and so they were competing with themselves in many ways So anyways, they're getting out of this business, you know big kind of What do you call it like a scar from like, you know a bruise from from going after this Their stock price is just in the shitter which is ironic because we're in this group chat We're from months like last year. Basically these guys have been our friends have been like pimping out. Oh, dude zillow zillow Is the zillow is a great box. Yeah, and I went about 25 thousand dollars worth exactly same I bought it.

I don't know like 50 or 100 thousand dollars worth of it and I'm down big everybody Everybody in the group is down for something. Yeah, we're all down like somewhere between 30 and 40 percent or something on this And I agreed with it I thought zillow I think zillow is the greatest thing ever because to me like what do you do when you're in a fancy neighborhood? Even if you're not buying a home, you just go on a zillow, you know, it's a category owner. They own it Right. Yeah, so so, you know zillow the stock is down big right now Uh, the funny thing is open door stock also took a beating So they're down like 12 just on the news that zillow failed at this people are like, uh, maybe open doors Also going to fail at this and then they came out with this god awful.

Did you see this tweet that they did? Um, the that open door did it's the worst. It's the absolute tone deaf idiot Just you know what the best thing to do is to make fun of them. So listen, you know what? Do you remember what biden did when uh, he was running for president? Which part forgetting he shut the fuck up because when you have a guy in the basement Yeah, when you have a guy like trump who does all the talking and like is his own worse enemy You shut up you hide and you don't say a word That's what open doors should have done.

They should have locked themselves up the basement and said Everyone is forgetting to mention us even though we do this exact same thing. You just shut up Um, and that's what they should have done Yeah, or they should have come out cocky They should have come out and posted a chart of how much ass they were kicking and just be like, uh, you know This is you know, this does this is a hard business Or it's not for everybody and then just post their chart of themselves kicking ass at the same time Zillow's dying on on the same business, but instead I'm gonna read this word for word You tell me if you understand one percent of this Open door just randomly tweets yesterday We're in the midst First of all, don't say midst.

We're in the midst of a generational shift towards a fully digital experience comma with large comma unmet need For seamless experience in real estate period What a circle jerk says nothing then they've replied to their own tweet With our track record of executional excellence in many years of investment and consumer experience technology pricing There's they're just saying words comma technology comma pricing comma and operations comma We are well hyphen positioned to meet consumer demand with a best comma in class product and service Open door is open for business. We have demonstrated strong growth unit economics We are energized to help homeowners nationwide with simplicity certainty and speed I saw this and I was like what the fuck the funny part the ironic part is this is done by somebody who's like Their comms the job is comms corporate comms.

They're a communication professional. This is their their actual job You want to know they forgot the number one most important rule for about copywriting. You know what that number one rule is No one cares about you. They only care about themselves Exactly. That's the number one rule if you remember that you're gonna be you're gonna be 90 percent of the way there No one cares about you. They only care about themselves It's like when you go to a website and they go we've been in business since 1994 Our pure our our passion is to serve you our dear customers We've been serving customers for a long time and we know that we're gonna have a lot of high integrity when we handle you It's like I don't care No one cares.

No one cares Yeah, exactly. They violated all the rules. What's another rule? Don't use words like that. Yeah, exactly. Talk like you speak. Talk like you speak Right, sorry, right like you speak and then Use like, you know, eighth grade reading level. You know, this is like, you know, 20th grade reading level and it said none of it None of it makes sense to the average person. They also didn't say anything of interest Like what did this mean this all this meant was please don't sell our stock. Please don't sell our stock. Please. Please. Please.

Please don't sell our stock We're we didn't make the mistake. They did and there were so many better ways to do this. So that was I thought so I think There's this idea. So like when I um was running the show basically at the household, um my staff would be like we need to change the landing page or We need to change the footer and I'm like, well, why and they go well because it's been the same forever And my analogy was always yeah, but you're thinking about it this kind of poorly for example Our office was on a corner and there was a billboard right there And I would say how many people do you think are going to see that billboard for Many many times in a row and they would say well, most people are probably just passing by and I go.

Yeah, I would agree with that Now, of course you and I we've been sitting here for a month now and we see that same billboard every single day So we're kind of sick of it, but nine out of ten people are just passing by and they're seeing it for the first time every time What you need to remember is that most people are not just sitting there. They're just a parade Well, you know walking by and that's what like open door kind of like realize they're like, oh well Yeah, most people like so they're probably in the thick of this and they're seeing Zillow flip out and they're like everyone is Everyone's talking about this.

Everyone's thinking about us. It's like no no no no no you are but mostly we don't give a Just shut up. Just be quiet Hide now's the time to hide Yeah, so yeah, I saw that and our friend did something pretty funny Yeah, so moise moise Ali he He tweeted he tweeted out and I love this tweet by the way, this is just a he's very he's a very good writer a great cocky tweet So he goes dear Zillow and rich Barton the CEO Zillow who by the way is badass um I'm sure today is a tough day.

I'd like to purchase all the homes you have on your balance sheet in one transaction Is that something you'd consider? I will pay cash and close to the 30 days. No contingencies are financing delays best comma M Signing off with the initial is the power move by the way I will never ever write my full name again because the initial is so good And uh, this is great. Obviously he's not gonna buy 2.8 billion dollars worth of stuff himself, but but maybe Maybe maybe he's maybe he's got some strategy here. Maybe he's got some money.

He could tap into I'm not sure um But yeah, also just like hilarious tweet in a way to kind of be out there on twitter and ride the ride the wave of Something happening Yeah, I thought this tweet was brilliant. He's a troll and I love when he trolls because he trolls in a very smart way Yeah, he's a cocky troll and you know the the weird thing is how did they lose money doing this? So like The from what I can tell the like single family homes, which is what they were buying Seeing a family home market is like at an all time high like people from covet are you know There was the great reassessment, which is what happened during covet everybody reassessed their job They're you know do what can I work from home? Oh wow? I didn't need to travel for business I could just do a zoom meeting and actually it works.

Do I need a gym membership? I could work out at home I could do I like this job or actually maybe now that I have this break I can I can think about what I really want to do and I pick up this hobby and you know Maybe when I'm at home in this marriage this marriage sucks, you know, maybe I should reassess that there was the great reassessment and During that a lot of people move they moved for different reasons If your job is remote you could leave high price places like California in New York.

You could relocate to other places If you're at home all the time, maybe you need more space and you want to Buy you don't want to buy a bigger bigger place with a bigger yard and bigger office space or whatever So people were buying more than ever and they were buying single family homes so people were leaving the cities and So condos were down inside San Francisco in New York Like 15 and single family homes were up 15 20 percent So I don't fully understand and I'm sure there's a totally logical explanation, but you know, it's like, how did you how did you lose money? Doing the one thing that everybody wanted you were buying and selling single family homes like and I think what they said was, you know, the price was too unpredictable um So we you know, we weren't able to do as well and the other thing they said was There's a labor shortage.

They couldn't get people to come flip the home. So like do the repairs you needed to to flip the homes Um, so yeah, I'm sure like that's really hard, but that's crazy. They weren't able to do it in a bull market Yeah, I think it's nuts. It doesn't make me like them anymore and I and I I'm a shareholder. I'm bummed. I guess I guess they should have just stuck to what they did You can hold your stock or you're gonna sell. I don't sell. So yeah, I'm gonna hold Okay, cool. Me too. Um, all right.

Anything else you want to do or we can wrap it up here? We'll wrap it up here. Um Don't forget to go to what was the URL? I'll write this podcast.com slash MFM as in my first million. So write this podcast Go leave us a review if you get if you get enjoyment of the show. That's kind of all we ask Helps us move up the charts helps us get more downloads. Go and then we're gonna I think we're we're gonna do one more thing. I believe what we're gonna do I'll kind of like I'll say briefly.

Um, I think we want to do something where you get We're gonna have a budget of like up to 20 grand a month and the people who create clips for us Sean and get the most views will give them a little bit of money Ah, okay. I like it. Yeah, I think Ben or Jonathan came up with that Okay, I like it. Yeah, I paid to listen. So it's a good deal Well, you paid to chop up clips and and they and they be creative. So kind of a good idea All right. All right. That's a pod
