# Roasting Business Ideas We Get Pitched All The Time

Model: Whisper-small

Today is the play of haters ball. Someone on Twitter asked for this. They go, hey, it's been a while since you guys did the play of haters ball. Can we get another episode? I was like, I don't know what was that? And he was like, back. It's like a few months ago, you did an episode where you guys unintentionally were like talking about ideas you don't believe in businesses. You don't think are good at businesses. You're kind of you're pointing out critiques of certain things. And he was like, that was cool. Do that again. And I was like, that's a good idea.

We should do that every once a while. All right, let's do it. I like to welcome all you to the ninth annual international player haters ball. Yeah, let's do it. All right. So the play of haters ball, what are the what are the ground rules? So the first is don't take this too seriously. We're just having fun. All right. But the second is we have categories. So there's the first one, I think, is the most important one, which is what are some bad ideas that are common? Right. So what's a bad idea that people commonly have? Are you commonly here? You commonly get pitched.

So let's hate on some bad ideas that are that are out there floating around and keep keep circulating what you got. All right. I'll say my four really quickly. So the number one, personal CRM is the problem being like I met this person, but I don't remember how I met them or their contact information. The personal seat, the second to do lists. They worked every once in a while. One could argue like a sauna maybe started that way, but like task management and to do lists very common, super hard to pull off. Our friend Andrew started one.

I forget what it was called. It involved like the word baseball. What was it? Well, a state stadium or a thing. Some wonder list. Well, maybe he's got some fucking thing. It sounded like a sports name. And so those suck. Number three, message aggregators. So like text.com, someone something that's trying to aggregate all of your messages that are one really hard to pull off. And the final one, something that you've actually invested in. And I will I would like to hear if you agree is most fitness apps. Yes. OK, I actually have another one that's on here.

OK, so do you want to I think we should do the why, right? People are going to hear that. Be like, why? Why are you saying that? So add yours, add yours, and then we'll go through. We'll go through. We can go in reverse. All right, cool. All right, mine. Music discovery. This is the most common one, which is like, oh, you know, why is it so hard to find great music that, you know, that you haven't heard of that you'll like? We're going to solve music discovery. We're going to solve music recommendations. Would you would you add podcasts into that? Oh, also, yeah, actually, as a general category, every podcasting business.

Every podcasting business. We make it easier to record. Yep, bad. We make it where podcasts listening up bad. Yeah, we help podcasters make money in ads. Pretty bad. And I say bad because here's my definition of bad. It doesn't mean there's no examples of success. That's not what I mean. For example, Pandora did a good job of giving people music recommendations and was successful. But you know, the founder of Pandora, the story is like 11 years of hell. Just to like just to get to a, I think, one or two billion dollar outcome in the end.

So like the best case scenario, the one company that made it through the and the first they were the first. And I think kind of the only since right? Like people say Spotify. That's not what Spotify does. Spotify did not win because it was good at recommending you new songs. You should listen to Shazam's pretty amazing. But again, it's like one of the only ones. I think when we say things are not good ideas, it means that they're needlessly hard and you probably could get a better outcome and something similar with the same amount of effort.

All right. And then I forgot to tell you this, but this is the most important thing. I can't believe we didn't talk about this earlier, to be honest with you. Because if you're listening to this and you like what you're hearing right now and you haven't gone and subscribed to the My First Million podcast, wherever you get your podcast, then that's the thing you've got to do. There's nothing more important than doing that right now. And don't do it because I said to do it. Do it because you want to do it. Do it because that's who you are.

Thank you for the perfect definition. Needlessly hard is the way I would. That's the perfect phrase for this. And I would say also, if you're working on one of these, that doesn't necessarily mean stop. Like anybody in the startup business is in the outlier business. So who cares if most people fail with these ideas? I would say starting a podcast is needlessly hard. And we did that. But if you think that it's easy, doable, obvious, straightforward, just as hard as anything else, that's the part you're wrong about. So make sure you're not delusional. If you're going in eyes wide open, fine.

OK, so some music discovery is definitely one. The next is apps that are like, oh, the world is too digital. We need to get people together in real life. So it's like figuring out when your friends are free and coordinating like a taco truck hangout. Sounds great as a story. Looks really cool at a pitch deck when you're just using a mock up. And it's like, look, five friends just said, yeah, I'm free. And we found the nearest location. And they had a great time. Like that dating app, Grupper. You remember Grupper? I remember Grupper well, yes.

I was seeing what Grupper was picking up. Oh, my god, it was awesome. It was really fun. But ultimately, basically what Grupper was was like me and Sean would sign up. We'd say we're two single guys. We're going to add our third friend, Ben. Grupper matches you with someone and tells you when to meet somewhere and you meet these three girls. And frankly, it's a lot of fun. But it's a group date. Yeah. In terms of business, they like suck because Tinder comes out and you're like, oh, F that I can get like 10 matches this week and like a date every day.

Exactly. And it turns out people really just want to lay in bed swiping mindlessly and like, you know, just be sitting there in their college sweats and like with their double chin and like not leave the house, not dress up, not actually go on a date yet. It's like if your product caters to somebody being lazier and getting a hit of dopamine, it's going to do better than somebody who's like, you know what? I want an authentic connection. So I'm not going to use photos and text messaging. I'm going to like arrange a hangout and coordinate it and go meet somebody in the real world and spend some quality time together.

You know, the more virtue signal you typically the worst, the worst idea is a general rule of thumb when it comes, especially for social products. My friend, Neville, made a living with his copyrighting course. And he was like, yeah, it's cool, but like I invested in copy AI because like that's way better. I'll just rather just have a machine write your copy for you and actually teach you how to do it. Right. Yeah, exactly. I wouldn't say that all virtue signals is bad. Like, for example, Tesla is kind of a virtue signal thing, which is like, let's save the planet and with electric cars.

But I would say if you hear a pitch with a heavy amount of virtue signaling about the way the world should be, just remember the Gary Halpert quote, like never has more money been lost trying to sell somebody something they should do instead of what they want to do. And so, you know, that's that's the focus. And even Tesla, when it started, it didn't make, you know, like the whole first premise was we need to make a sexy car, right? A car people want the Roadster and he said the performance of a Ferrari like the speed of a Ferrari with the the efficiency of a Prius.

And so he knew that if you're going to change the perception, you're going to get people to want this, you got to make it sexy. OK, so what are the other ideas? Pay to talk to mentors. I see this idea a lot. Yeah, I remember this with Clarity FM. I was like, oh, really smart idea. And it was wrong. And then I've seen five versions of it. It's all wrong since the version of this you see is like, hey, wouldn't wouldn't it be cool if you could just set an hourly rate and then somebody could call you, you know, and they could pay, you know, five cents a minute to whatever five dollars a minute to talk to you for 15 minutes.

And it's like a cool way to match mentors and mentees. And typically this comes from the startup world where somebody is like, well, mentors can be really valuable. What if I productize this? And the version of this that does work is GLG, where it's like, dude, I'll pay you two thousand dollars because I'm a hedge fund. And I'm making a very large, multi million dollar bet. And I need to talk to an industry expert who I will overpay stupidly for an hour of their time to get some insider, you know, inside baseball on this industry.

Yeah. It's basically like a due diligence versus what most do is like it's a consultant call, not a mentor call. Exactly. And, you know, mentorship, I think Naval said this and I loved it. He goes mentors, mentorship, seeking mentors is an advanced form of procrastination. You know, like if you're going to win, you're not going to win because you've needed mentors up front. You will you will have mentors along the way and they will be valuable, but they're going to come a somewhat organically as you make shit happen. And B, they're going to help you not because they're getting paid five dollars a minute, they're going to help you because they like what you're doing.

They like that you take feedback, you do shit, and then you follow up with them. And you need to do that to get mentors, not like not go ask somebody to be in a relationship with you, you know, or right off that. Anyone who you can pay $100 an hour to talk to, you don't want to talk to. Right. Like if you if you're on one of these websites, like the likelihood that you're someone I want to like the people I want to talk to the ones I got to beg. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And the people they want to talk to are not the people that want to pay them.

It's people that are doing interesting things that are like inspiring, awesome, ambitious people that they want to be around. All right. That's the next one. Let's do another one. Education platforms that are about education. OK, so what do I mean by this? I invest in a lot of ed tech. But if you'll notice when I invest in tech, it's because it's selling education. It's not. I say it's education as a name. It is not selling education, for example. And I'm not saying all these businesses are going to work out, but they're at least they're worth a bet.

You know, Lambda School wasn't selling an education. It was selling, getting a job. And so that's why I was able to like get to tens of millions a year in revenue. And people kind of hate on it now. They think it's going to fail because, you know, they had they had some layoffs or whatever, whatever, juries out. But getting to tens of millions in revenue was sort of no joke. But at least they were selling an outcome that somebody wanted. Instead of selling information, they sold a job. What are you talking about? Like Skillshare? No, that like Lambda Schools are good example of that.

Like they're basically no no no no no. An example of selling just education. All right. What's going on? Just a quick break, a quick interruption. Scroll down into the description box on YouTube and you're going to see a link to the hustle. The hustle is a daily email. It gives you all you need to know about business and tech news. I started it years ago and it's awesome. It's kind of how this podcast got started. So check it out. The hustle. Scroll down. Do it. Oh, no, you won't even have heard of the names that I'm talking about because they get nowhere, right? Because it's like, for example, why do I go to HustleCon the conference? Well, do I go for the information? I don't know.

Let's go look at the YouTube channel. Let's see that when the Pandora guy gives his like, you know, Magnum Opus of like, you know, amazing information. No one watches. It's got 1500 views, right? Like, you know, I go to meet people on TikTok and get more than 1500 views. It's like the information is out there. It's free. It's accessible. You don't need them to be a mentor. He explains in depth exactly what he did and nobody cares. Nobody was and watches it. And so that's the problem with education as education. And he's given that same talk and dozens of different conferences.

Right. And it's like, well, why do you have him talk there? Not for the information because it's cool to say the Pandora guys here and people like that they went and they get to meet other people at the event. And that's why they go to conferences. So I like education sold as certification, education sold as peers, networking, education sold as getting a job, but not education for the information. All right. Last one. Any business that requires influencers or celebrities to be one side of your market. Now there are there are examples that work for sure.

Cameo, whatever. Why is this a bad business? It's not a bad business because it doesn't work. It's a bad business because it sucks to run. I have done this many times. And like, I literally feel so dirty at the end of every workday because I've just been groveling at the feet of these managers and and like, you know, YouTube celebrities, Twitch stars, you know, Hollywood celebrities, just begging them to please do this thing that's clearly in their best interest. And the reason I say it's a bad business is because you won't walk out with your dignity.

That's the problem of celebrity based businesses is that. Similarly, businesses where you have to hire lots of journalists, journalists, very, very challenging to manage, very, very hard. Typically, they're not like aligned with like wanting to make a lot of money. And so you're like, well, we got to do this to make money. And oftentimes the journalists are like, yes, so I don't I don't care. Yeah. You don't want to be negotiating with your own employees to do the job. And that's what happens if you hire a certain type of person. I remember we had an engineer that was like that.

He he was like, we had this platform Blab that was growing. It's kind of like a version of Clubhouse back in the day. And we had gotten to a million users and we were all celebrating. And he's like, yeah, but have we really made an impact yet? And I was like, what do you mean? And he's like, you know, how much of this content on here is just junk? And I was like, yeah, a lot of it for sure. Right. Like how much content on YouTube, on television, and you know, on the radio is just junk food.

Yeah. Like a lot of it, how much content in the grocery store is junk food? A lot of it. And he's like, wouldn't it be great if this was used for like, I don't know, like a physics professor teaching whatever I go, we actually have that, you know, that guy on YouTube who's got the big physics following. He's on here. He gets a hundred viewers to show up. It's not my fault. Martin Shkreli gets 10,000. Like, you know, this is the we're not choosing what people should watch. They are choosing what they should watch. And he was, you know, he really felt like we needed to like basically throw away the growth in order to like serve the world better.

And I'm not saying that he was wrong. I'm saying he was in the wrong business because that's not what we were trying to do. And it's also not pragmatic. It's and also it's a lot easier to do good stuff just because it's good when you're already big. For sure. Yeah. And you know, what you got to do is, you know, you build tools, you build open platforms, but at the end of the day, people are going to do what they want with them. I don't think you could play God in that way when you're when you're building software.

Now, you can market to certain markets and we did that, right? We marketed to teachers and whatever. But I think my meta point is it sucks to be at a business where your employee base, you have to negotiate with them to do the mission of the company. That's that kind of is very frustrating. So those become bad businesses to be to be a part of, not because they can't work because they're very draining. And that's the same thing with like celebrity based businesses. Every business that I mentioned, as well as your real life one and maybe your music one, it's the mentor ones different.

But the ones that I mentioned, personal CRM to do this and messaging aggregators and as well, fitness app, not entirely, but it's the problem with them is that they're just not that important. Like people don't actually need them or they already have one that they probably like already and also they don't need it that badly. So if you start using it, you just can like if it goes away tomorrow, like most people aren't going to be upset about it. Yeah. Yeah. And I think, you know, the key, the key, if you're going to build one of these, as you say, yeah, typically these businesses really shitty for this reason.

But like let's take music, but maybe regulations have changed or maybe the industry is now opened. There's now a licensing protocol you can use to like get the rights. So it used to suck because getting the rights sucked, but now getting the rights doesn't suck anymore. Or this used to be personal CRM used to suck because, you know, it's only for power networkers. You know, like Mark Andreessen did a Twitter Q&A yesterday and he somebody was like, what's a what's a startup you wish somebody would build? He goes, I've been, you know, I don't know if he meant it as a joke or not, but he goes, I'm still waiting on that personal CRM.

I was promised dot, dot, dot. And, you know, I'm sure for a guy like Mark Andreessen, who's got like thousands of contacts that he'd love to stay in touch with, personal CRM would be incredibly useful. He also probably has two executive assistants and like, you know, gets to meet everybody. It's not a product for the masses. And so you're really selling to like a niche audience and then they have to maintain it. So you'd have to say what changed where that bad idea is now actually a good idea. And those are sometimes the best ideas when something used to be seen as bad, but now is good because something has changed in the landscape.

I call that an inflection. So there's like a political inflection. So something has changed, you know, a regulation has changed. There's a cultural inflection. So like, you know, we're willing to date online now. It's not embarrassing. And then there's, so there's a handful of different style of inflection. So what inflection has happened that makes this possible? Right. And if you can't answer that, then, you know, you're probably going to end up kind of in the ditch, just like the other thousand people who tried the same concept or similar concept before you. All right. You want to go into depth on any of those or you want to switch to the next one? Let's switch.

So the next one is bad ideas that other things are good right now. And basically things that are like seen to be doing well in the outside, but we think they're bad ideas. High valuation, a lot of press, a lot of praise, critical claim. We're not what do you got? I'll go first here. Most direct to consumer products, I think are dog shit. Like they're pretty. They've got cute branding. You're saying the product is dog shit or the business is dog shit or both? The product, not necessarily the business. I think it could make a lot of money.

I also think that like the branding could be cute. And I think their customer acquisition could be amazing. And so they could, the business could be good, but it's really hard to out research and develop Nike. It's not impossible, but it's really challenging to do. And most I don't think even attempt to do that. And so I think a lot of direct to consumer businesses, not all, but many are just selling really shitty inferior products. Okay. I like that. I think that's true. I can think of five cases where that's true. And the reason I think it's true is because for a direct to consumer company to win the formula is not amazing product.

Amazing product with good, you know, like, you know, decent distribution. It's amazing distribution with good enough product. Yeah. And I don't think it's always the case. Being amazing at Facebook ads and good enough at product is the general winning formula for DTC. I'm drinking common, common to your coffee. It's awesome. I love it. Have you tried Comma tier coffee? Wait, what does it call? Come on. What's it called? Comma tier. There's two of them. Comma tier and Comma tier. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe maybe you are. I thought you were just mispronouncing it.

I think I mispronounced it. How do you spell it? It's there's no D. And then T. Oh, come and tier whatever. It's called the popular. Maybe that's another name for your short term rental ranch. Come and tier. Comment here. This coffee. It's awesome. The product is amazing. I actually I get the hype. I'm on board with it. But I've had I get so many Instagram ads for workout shorts and I've ordered a ton of different ones and I've spent a lot of money like hundreds of dollars on trying out these different shorts. Lululemon and Nike is cheaper and better in just in all categories of these like workout clothes.

So that's an example. Yeah, that's a good one. All right, let me give you one similar. Thrasio. So Thrasio is currently valued at $10 billion. And the idea behind Thrasio is that they go buy up Amazon merchants. So they go buy up Amazon kind of FBA businesses and they roll them all up and they say, this is amazing. Look at this in three years. We now have $400 million or whatever it is of cumulative revenue because we bought all these businesses using a shit ton of debt. And we now have like operational efficiencies because we brought a bunch of things in internal centrally and and we bought the we bought all these brands.

OK, so why do I think so? So I'm not saying that Thrasio won't succeed. Thrasio itself might might succeed. I've invested in one of these that's in LADAM and I actually really like it. But the there's a couple of challenges. So here's here's why there basically they're kind of like shining up a turd. Right. Like because they're buying kind of crap and hoping to if you throw all that crap together, it is no longer crap. But now it's just a bigger pile. It's just a big pile of crap. Like it's not like it's not like particularly interesting.

Like you have an efficient bucket full of poop. I think they would disagree in that like, you know, you could buy a crappy Amazon business or you could buy a great one, right? You buy one that is just some random Alibaba product with no value add and no brand and no loyalty or you buy a good one. Right. So I'm not saying it's that. But why is this bad? So our buddy Andrew Wilkinson, the first time I heard about this, I go, oh, this is actually pretty clever. They're rolling up these stores on Amazon. I hadn't really heard of anyone doing it.

And at the time it was clever. It was sort of novel. They were buying them at amazing multiples because nobody else was in the market. And and what he said was he goes, yeah, this is kind of like they are racking up a lot of revenue, but he goes, I feel like it's picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. And I think it's like some Charlie Munger quote or something like that. And what's the steamroller? The steamroller is these businesses are 100 percent dependent on Amazon. They all want to say that they can create their their own independent brands.

Very, very hard to do. Very few do them. And so Amazon, you know, they can sometimes just remove merchants. They can change the algorithm. They could just like promote their own basics on top of your products. There's a bunch of ways where your business can go to shit overnight. And now you have a bunch of debt on businesses that you no longer are buying on cheap multiples, you're buying on, you know, really high multiples. Because a bunch of people said, oh, Thrasio built a ten billion dollar company doing this in like four years. Yeah, us too.

And so I've seen, you know, 10 more of these come out. And so so I think there's a good way to do this and a bad way to do this. And I think a lot of people are going to do the bad way to do this. Bad way would be buying ones that are super dependent on Amazon. That are in, you know, undifferentiated, kind of like products or categories at really high multiples is and also lying to yourself about the centralization. Some things, some like maybe like back office books and stuff like that can be done centrally.

But like when you remove the operator out of a business, it's really hard to keep growing. And so, you know, I think that when you buy one vacuum brand and then you buy one pet food brand, like there's not like a lot of synergies, you know, between those two. And so I think they overrate the synergy that's between the brands. That's my. I have a friend who's doing this for Shopify stores and I'm going to introduce you to him. You know him, but I can't mention him. And he's doing it for Shopify stores. And I think that's kind of, that's far more interesting because it's just a Shopify is way better.

Because they own the customer and they're an independent brand that got built. And depending on the multiple and whatnot, you can do well here. So I like the general model, but of like ecommerce and rollups, but not the Amazon ones. Okay, you got another one? No, just D to C, because I don't like a lot of the D to C products. But you tweeted this out. You got more ideas than I did. Yeah, you want me to give you some of the good ones that came out of it? Yeah, because I didn't want to go through your comments.

I didn't want to go through your stuff. And don't say clubhouse. Oh, dude, you know, I think I made myself clear on that one a long time ago. All right, so here we go. Let me pull this up. Okay, so one that came up was like, OK, so in crypto, there was like a long list of of like crypto things that are high market cap right now. But, you know, make very little to, you know, make basically no sense. And as to why they would have that much value. So let me give you a list.

So my buddy Vishal gave me a good one here. He goes, he gave me a list in crypto. So this is this is just for the crypto people out there. So he, OK, in crypto, he goes, light coin, there is no purpose or place in the market. Bitcoin cash, no purpose or place in the market. Ethereum classic. And so Bitcoin cash and Ethereum classic. These are just forks of Bitcoin, forks of Ethereum that like their but their case for both of them is we're going to stay true to the original vision. But like the public has voted and they went with like the one that's evolving.

Ripple also no purpose, also a security also scam. And like all these combined, I think have like a hundred billion dollar market cap. So that's a hundred billion dollars of value that that should be probably closer to zero than than even 10 billion. He gave me some good ones that were public market companies as well. So here's this case, GameStop trading up because of Wall Street Bets. It's physical distribution stores for a digital product, video games. Hard to argue with that. Yes, but GameStop, I don't think really sells games. They sell like remote controls and like toys and shit.

Yeah, but all that can be ecommerce, right? You don't need you don't need like a thousand locations to do that. And they have no like they have no like they have no like monopoly on that, right? Like everybody anybody can like the the the game maker can sell. So those are correct. Lift. So why lift? He goes, so here's the case against lift. Uber and lift both have like to keep raising prices because they can't keep losing money anymore. And after a decade, they're still not making money. And Uber at least has like two things going for it.

It has like a self driving like dream, which is still pretty far away. But, you know, they at least had a self driving department. Lift doesn't does not even have that. And then the other thing is Uber has stakes in the Uber for China, Uber for you know, like DD, I think. Yeah, Uber for China, DD. They have the Uber for India. They have the Uber for wherever they have like a they own a piece of those companies like 20 percent, 10 percent. And lift does not have that outside of doesn't have anything outside of North America.

So this is case against. So I thought those were kind of interesting. Those are kind of interesting ones. Yeah, the lift one, man, it's fine. It could, I think, you know, people are like, oh, it's way overhyped or like, this is way underhyped for lift. I would say it's pretty, it's fairly hyped. It's like it's fairly rated. It's a very fairly rated thing. Like how big is left? What's your, do you know what their market cap is? Like four or five or six billion. No, 15. 15. That seems fair. Like, I don't know. Like it.

That seems fairly, fairly rated. Right. So I don't think it's going to go anywhere. Okay, fair enough. A bunch of people said bolt because the founder who came on our pod recently, they're like, you know, this guy is getting a black on Twitter. I think people said anything that crazy guy is doing. That's what someone said on your on your reply. Anything that that guy is doing. Yes. That was probably the next one. And then the other one that I totally disagree with, by the way, is Facebook. Facebook or meta tons of people are just like met as, you know, here's met as graveyard.

Dude, my business is like my personal business alone gave Facebook like, I don't know, three or four million dollars last year. It's like that is money we pay to Facebook just to rent a piece of their news feed. It is like, you know, 90% profit margin on that. Like, you know, they're selling not a physical product. They own, you know, so many different huge properties. Like it's crazy to me that people are just like that this thing is lost like $400 billion in market cap in like a week or a month. I mean, it is.

I don't think that that's actually crazy that they've lost a market share, but it's not going to go away. You know, it's kind of like, you know, what did AOL go away in like 2008 or something? Was that like 12 years ago? Like when it when did it peak? Hold on. You why? Why would Facebook lose $400 billion of market cap last month? What changed? Well, I don't. I can't speak exactly to numbers, but to say like, why would it go down? I think it's just like, I think I do think that there, there are less people are starting to use it.

I think that that Apple changed with their ad targeting that screwed them up a little bit. And I also think that the perception is actually bad. I think TikTok is like young people think it's cooler. And so I don't think there's anything significant going on today. But I think that what the fear is like, oh man, like young people really prefer TikTok over anything Facebook related. Yeah, I think that's true. But you know, that's been going on for a while. I don't know. Like I just feel like market just swings like crazy. You know, like, for example, OK, here's the case against the case against is they can't acquire the next social app because of antitrust.

So, you know, what they did with Instagram and with WhatsApp, that won't work anymore. They're not going to build the next social app themselves. So they're kind of like that. Like they can't acquire TikTok or the next the next TikTok. That's true. But then the answer to that is change did hurt their ad business. That's true also. You could say, well, the ending about Oculus, which I actually do think is going to be amazing. I think they have one of the most ruthless, successful CEOs of all time at the helm now probably pissed off. I think they have the best bet on virtual reality.

So that, you know, that I think is is a pretty big thing going for them with Oculus and Oculus is doing like silently doing pretty well. People think VR is like nowhere, but it's actually doing pretty well. The you know, the third thing is that they have the, you know, the greatest ad juggernaut in the world. And I I guarantee you, like, you know, I think they I think they lost like 10 billion in ad revenue because of like the iOS change. Trust me, these guys are going to figure out what to do. They're going to figure out how to target the ads again without the cookie.

They will come up with something. They're not just going to like die. You think they're going to just let that die? You know, they're going to figure out something else instead of the cookie to target the ads. Well, all right. Can I tell you about bad billionaires? That was a category. That's going to be the most interesting. I've got two in mind. All right. Good, because I got none. All right. Great. I've got two. I'm going to go with the shocking one first. Now, this is going to sound crazy. And I want to say that there's no proof to what I'm saying other than a video that I showed you.

You're actually going to say this. Oh my God. Well, no, I'm not going to say how you think I'm going to say it. I think Richard Branson is not a wonderful person. So before the before the podcast, there's this video of him. What year is that video? 99? There's something. Is it in the? Yeah. It's in it's in it's on YouTube. And if you Google Richard Branson, Selma Hayek, it's Richard Branson is on the Conan Obrine show. Selma Hayek, obviously, like one of those beautiful, awesome women on earth, Richard Branson comes on, sits Selma on his lap and like is clearly flirting.

I think he's like kissing her neck like it's fucking embarrassing. It's what it is. And I whenever I saw that video, I was like, oh, I don't look up to you anymore. That that that was pretty bad. You watch that video? Yeah, I did. You sent it. I watched part of it. It was kind of uncomfortable. So I just stopped watching it because he kind of like. Like, are they friends? Are they cool? Like, you know, dude, even if you are cool, that's weird to me. That behavior is weird to me. And then I'm like, was this cool in 1998? If people do this type of thing in 1990, no, man, I really remember.

Even the crowd is like, like it's uncomfortable. And it's on live TV and she's trying to like be polite and not make a big deal out of it. But you could tell she's not like down with that. And I read his book. I read his book and like so I'm not on board with him anymore, actually. So that's what that's I'll leave it at that. Is that a fair assessment? No, hold on. Hold on. What did you read in his book? Or is that irrelevant to what you're? Oh, he was just cheating on his wives and and he just seemed like a guy who.

It's OK that he has his lifestyle, but I could see how that could put a lot of people uncomfortable and easily cross lines, even if his intentions aren't to cross the line. You know what I mean? Like he was like a hippie a little bit. You know what I'm saying? So this is truly the play I hate is ball. Because you're hating the play I hear, right? Like this guy, you know, like Richard Branson. First of all, the guy looks like he's always having a great time. You ever watch this guy in Necker Island? You go see these dudes videos.

I think that's part of the stick. Yeah, there's definitely like once the Jeffrey Epstein stuff came out, you're like, oh, wait, what are these really rich people doing on these islands? Like what's going on over here? Do I need to like, you know, like make a note, you know, tell my daughter like never, ever go with a billionaire to an island? Like, you know, what do I think that's a safe role? I think that's a safe role. Right. That's a good role. I'm down with that one. That one down. Yeah. Put that on the refrigerator.

I'm OK with that one. Yeah. So I don't know. Like, I don't know what wrong doing. He's been accused of. He's pretty inspiring. Oh, and that's what I'm saying. I don't know if there's any accusations. I've got zero proof of anything I'm saying other than just one video and just a vibe. It's just a vibe. It's just an energy. Yeah, you're coming in strong with a pretty wild, wild portrayal. No, no, I'm saying it's all energy. I'm saying that there's zero proof other than this one video that I saw. That's it. That's all I'm saying.

And the second one. So there's this guy named Naveen Jane. Do you know who this guy is? He's always on like the cover of Inc. And he's always on like these Tony Robbins things and he's incredibly charismatic. He's got a good smile. Let me tell you about this guy. So do you know anything about him? I know a lot about him, but I want you to say the story. Because I don't think most people know anything about him. All right, so even to this day, he's considered a billionaire and he's like I said, he's on the cover of all these magazines.

This is like wonderful entrepreneur. So I'm going to give like a high level summary of his background. So started at Microsoft in 89, probably got wealthy from that. In the early or mid to late 90s, he started a company called Info Space. Info Space went public and he eventually was worth like eight billion dollars. What Info Space did was it's kind of hard to explain because it's so old and we don't even use that anymore. But like they like helped to make like directories and maps that you would put on your website. So like just stuff that isn't even relevant anymore.

But it was just like a dot com business. And the stock went public and crushed. It was at one hundred and thirty eight dollars and then it completely crashed. And in March of 2000, it was now worth a dollar fifty six. And Info Space, they use a ton of controversial accounting methodologies. And so they said that they made forty six million dollars in profit, but they got sued or and people got angry at them. And because in reality, they actually lost almost three hundred million dollars and a ton of their employees filed suit along with a lot of their shareholders filed suit because they promise employees like different stock options.

And it just went to shit. And it was kind of built on like a bunch of lies and a little bit of vaporware. So that happens in 2003. This guy, Jane, is ordered to pay two hundred fifty million dollars for violation. I don't know what short. I don't know if you I don't know if you said this, but basically the the stockholders or the employees, the stockholders, they all lost their money, but he ended up making out rich off of Info Space. You said that part or no? No, but yeah, that was like the biggest part.

So like he sold a lot of his stock and he made a huge sum of money. A lot of the other people did not. Right. Then after that, he starts this other company. Have you heard of this other company called? How do you pronounce it? Intellis. Intellis. Intellis, the best way to describe it and I think a lot of people know what this is. But whenever you get like a scam phone number to your phone and you Google it and you search on Google and it says like which number came up and you type it in and it's like, well, and you get all these ads like for the background check of this person, just enter in their information and you inevitably enter in your mom and dad's information to see like, oh, have my parents are a bit arrested, let's find out.

And it says like, well, we found Donna Parr in Missouri. You can for only $18, you can get her criminal history report and you're tricked into buying a $19 a month subscription. And I actually posted in a picture. If you look at the picture on the dock of the actual scam, but basically this company grew to be really big, hundreds of millions in revenue. And then it came out that they were getting sued constantly because consumers were like, I didn't know that I was signing up for this. And I've been getting billed $20 a month.

$20. Yeah. $20 subscription. I'm getting billed for because the font in like size two underneath the check box said like, by the way, this is going to charge you money every month. Yes. And the actual landing page that I sent to you, it's a screenshot and it says something like get $10 for giving us information about yourself. But then also underneath that in a really small running, it says, and after that we charge you $19 a month like for this and that. And so it's pretty scammy. Now, here's the reason, one of the reasons why he's on the cover of all these magazines is he's starting a company that helps mine minerals on different planets.

That sounds cool and everything, but the fact that like he has had this history of shadiness, I think I'm not, I'm not on board with that. Yes. And just to kind of like recap here, I think the story is he, he was found guilty of insider trading. He then tried to sue his law firm saying, you didn't provide me adequately with coverage of law and then he ended up getting hit with a $247 million. I don't know if you got 24, $247 million or he made $247 million. No, he had to settle. He had to pay.

He had to pay $100 million, I think. I'm not 100 percent sure on that. I got to get a look for that. And then Intelius just sold to a private equity company after all that kind of like, you know, after all that hot water. And then now is he so he's doing the moon mining thing. I've seen that he and he has another thing that measures like your your I think it just like measures your poop, doesn't it? It's like your gut stuff. And I don't know much about that. Yeah, that one, you saw that one, like the FBI or somebody, they get that.

The whole company's got office got raided because the founders were like, you know, like basically lying or cheating or some crime, basically. And then the founders got kicked out. This company had raised a bunch of money. I don't know the exact story here. Let me let me look that up. No, I think you're thinking of biome versus vio. Oh, OK. And I think they did the exact same thing. But so that's why I said I thought the same thing. I was like, I remember this couple, they looked like a couple and they got arrested. Yeah, it was a couple.

OK, so that's biome, not vio. I think. But that doesn't even matter. I think that if you are like this prolific in terms of like even if you're accused this often of stuff, it doesn't mean you did it. But it means like, hmm, like, why does this? What's the common denominator here? It's you. What's going on here? Yeah. So anyway. That's that's my list. Am I going to get in trouble for saying all these people? I don't think so. But I don't know. Ben is like doing a combination of like face bombing and yawning at the same time.

So I don't know what's going on. Are you bored or are you cringing at the libel? It means I know I'm going to have to edit like 15 minutes out of this podcast. All right. Yeah, I think we just cut this whole section just to reduce risk. It's not worth it. I don't think I said anything wrong. I stand by it. All right. You want to go to bad investment strategies? Yeah, you have one for this bad investment strategy. What investment strategies do you think are you hear about or are common that you think are bad bad strategies at the moment? The bad investment strategy.

The biggest one is buying a home and saying you're doing it because it's a good financial investment. If you look at can it be a good financial investment? 100 percent every once in a while, particularly in the market that we're in now. It just freaking works. But if you look at the trailing 50 years, let's say even the trailing 25 years, buying a home does not make a lot of money. And people go, well, A, I'm not throwing away money on rent and B, I actually made a profit and for the last 20 years, and for those people, I say, well, you're kind of stupid because you don't understand opportunity cost.

Because what you don't understand is that with your down payment money, you could have been paying an equal or even higher amount of rent, but you put your down payment money into a similarly risked asset, like public equities like the S&P 500, and made actually more profit. And they go, well, so what are you saying? I should never buying a house? I go, no, you should definitely buy a house. You should buy the same house for the same reason why I've got a fancy car because it makes me happy. That's why you should buy a house.

Yeah, the only other reason you would is because you want a, like you said, you want the house and B, you can get a mortgage for a pretty cheap interest rate. And it's pretty clear that interest rates are going to go up in the future. And so if you could lock in 30 years at 2.5% or whatever right now, that's a pretty good deal. That's a pretty cheap. But I agree. But the reasoning should still be because it makes you happy. Because even if you look at the trailing 15 years of data and you assume a 3.5%

interest rate, you would have likely have made more money. Now we're talking about averages, more money. If had you put that money into the S&P 500 and rented a home, that was of equal quality. Right. All right. My bad investment strategy that I hear often right now, and this is going to sound weird because I'm doing the milk road. Clearly I'm bullish on crypto is, I'm going to give you two categories. One is NFTs in general. I think that so much money is going to be lost and made, but the losses will far outweigh the gains for NFTs.

When we look back like five years from now, I think it is nuts what people are doing with NFTs. They would, you know, like if you basically just described the same asset class, but without the word NFT, you would say like, yeah, cool. How much money are you putting into baseball cards? How much are you putting into works of art? How much money are you putting into these? Why do you believe that this digital art, that you put this picture of a ping when you bought, is the better investment than those? Or how about let's just simplify it.

I'm going to give you 15 seconds to describe why you bought this NFT. And the only thing you're not allowed to say is that I think it might go up. And like, you know, the answer for most people is this sucker is going up. Right. And then the second worst answer they give you is the community. It's like, oh, you really you bought it for the community. What does that mean? What does the community? Tell me about this community. Oh, it's a community of people who all want this sucker to go up. Oh, cool. So you're all cheering for the same, you know, like, you know, greater full outcome.

And so I think for a huge number of, obviously there's going to be winners in NFTs, right? People are going to do well. Well, some projects are going to do well. And also, if you like it, buy it. Yeah. If you're if you're literally buying because you like the picture of the art and you really want to own that penguin, fantastic, but be honest with yourself. Almost everybody who's doing it right now is doing it because they think, you know, I'm hoping that this is the next one that goes up like crazy. And just call it what it is.

If it's a lottery ticket, it's a lottery ticket. And just say you're buying lottery tickets for, you know, $1,000 pop. And if that's really what you want to do, do it. But I just think it's generally quite a bad strategy for people to do. You were the first one who told me about NFTs and you bought one that I thought was awesome. I'm not even a basketball fan, but you bought this Kobe one and he like was dunking and turning into an angel. And I was like, oh, that's pretty awesome. That's sick. But you sold it and you made a profit like $10,000 in profit, right? Yeah, I bought it for maybe like, I don't know, $600, $800.

And then I sold it for 10, 10 grand like a month later. What's it worth now? It trades for about $2,500 now. And I actually, the reason I actually think that might be an NFT, I'm proud of that one. That was a, just to learn and be, I thought the art was cool, but I thought the art was so cool that I almost went back and bought it again yesterday. I was like, I think you should have. And I was like, I think you should have. I was like, I actually really like this, like, this is just a really cool piece of art.

And this time, if I buy it, it's not to learn or to see if it'll go up. It's because I actually like this one, but I have so many other NFTs in my wallet that are just like, I bought it because, hey, maybe this is going to be the next one that people pour their money into. And I get this fabulous run up. But those are scratch off tickets. And like, do I really want to be buying $300 or $500, that $800 scratch off tickets? It seems like a pretty bad idea. It seems like it's not investing at all actually.

It shouldn't even be called an investing strategy. How much money? I sound so ignorant. When you say that, when someone says that they've bought $1,000 of Bitcoin, although it's now worth a million dollars, what do you call the $1,000? Your basis? Yeah, your basis. So what was your basis for? How much did I put into NFTs? Yeah. So these probably in total, maybe like five grand, something like that, five, 10 grand. I didn't buy any of the super expensive NFTs. And yeah, so I did well because early on there was this thing called Nifty Gateway and they were doing curated drops.

So it was like one of the good things that was happening was like, yeah, they're doing well still. So that's where the Kobe one came out of. There's this artist that I had followed for a long time. This guy, Boss Logic, he makes all the UFC posters. So you've definitely seen his stuff because he's Joe Roken will repost his stuff from time to time. So he, Boss Logic did the Kobe one. So that's why I was like, oh, I actually like this artist. I follow him. I've bought like a print of his before. I'll buy his NFT.

So that was a good move. And then the other one, then I got caught up in the hype and bought like five of this thing called the Aku. It's just like a whatever you can Google it. It's just AKU. And I bought those just thinking like, oh, are these all just like positive flips? And so I bought five of them for, I want to say like $700 each. And then I've sold four of them, each one for about $1,500 now, $2,000. So I basically doubled my money on four of them. And then I kept the last one just to like, just to own basically.

So I did well with those. And then I have other ones in my wallet that like, you know, I bought for a few hundred dollars and they're worth, I think zero. Like, I think they literally like, you could not, I could not give it away if I wanted to just give it away to somebody. I wouldn't, nobody would pay the gas fee to pick it up. Our friend Jack was selling a, it was like a lock box. It was like a box that was like, and after you bought it, it would be unveiled like what the art was.

And I thought that was actually kind of neat. I'm not like, Jack's my homie. I'm not like, if it was like, if I was like someone who's like, I'm a true fan of where I was like, I'd be honored to own anything you've made, then maybe I could see myself doing that. But people were doing that with him and it was pretty amazing. Yeah. Yeah. I think NFTs are cool. They're going to have a place. I just think that most, the way that most people are investing in them right now is scratch off lottery tickets.

And I think that that's a bad strategy. And the last one, we'll wrap it up with this one. Well, I'll do one more. Something that bothers me, I know people personally who do this is they don't know how, are you in debt at all? Yeah. Like like at like a 6% interest rate? No. A lot of people don't understand. One and a half percent. Okay. One and a half percent. If you can get, if you can borrow money at a one and a half percent, you don't need to rush to pay it off. I mean, if it emotionally makes you happy, like pay it off.

I know people who don't want to have mortgages, but I'm like, man, if you could like, if you have a way to make more percentage than that loan, don't pay that debt off quickly. And also make sure you pay off the six and seven percent off stuff immediately and like just chill on that one percent. I know a lot of people whom they pay their student loans, they just like, they like spread a thousand dollars equally across all of them. And I'm like, no, you idiot. You do the six, you do like the six percent first.

And it's, I think that's shockingly common. Yeah. Do you, uh, you also borrow against your stocks, right? And you borrow it like the one percent or whatever. Yes. I'm about to pay it back though. Why? Because I'm gonna be like, that's free money. That right? Like you borrow at one percent. You could put that into anything and beat the one percent, right? Yes. So I, once I, so I used, I used it for taxes and real estate projects. And when the real estate project fulfills itself or, you know, like, I, I, I sell it, I'm gonna put, I'm going to keep the profit and I'm going to put the principal back into the loan and then I'm, but then I'm going to use the loan again to buy another thing.

Right. You know what I mean? And, and, and yeah. So, and mostly that's for peace of mind because you like to push it up. I keep it like really low, uh, because I don't want to ever do a margin call. But yeah, I definitely borrow against it. Yeah. I think that is like the biggest, uh, wealth hack that rich people have access to, which is like, if once you have like, you know, multimillion dollar stock portfolio, whether it's an index fund or it's, you know, collection of blue chips or whatever, to be able to borrow against that at one to one and a half percent and then just put that back.

You can put it back in the stock market and average seven percent, right? You're, you're getting a free six percent yield on that money. But you can only borrow at least that market sale and you can. So, um, if you use that money to purchase real estate or a handful of other things, you can borrow, I think up to 70% of your portfolio. If you intend to buy stocks with it, you could only borrow up to 50% and I think the interest rate is higher. And so, what you could do is with the 70%, you could go and purchase like, um, like I'm in this fund where they just own like a ton of Walgreens.

And so it's like pays off like a 6% or 5%. I forget what it is. Pretty good. And it's real estate income. So it's discounted and, um, like it's safe enough that Walgreens would have to go out of business or get hurt in order to go away. Yeah, exactly. Everything has risks. Uh, you know, do your own research and figure that out. But I just think that that the ability to borrow capital at 1%, at 1.5% is a, uh, it's a hack. I mean, it's a huge life hack. You could just live off that. So you also don't even have to go invest it.

You could just live off that, stay invested, keep your stuff compounding and just use that instead of income and don't pay tax on it because it's a, it's, it's borrowed money. It's not income. And so, you know, there's a bunch of things you can do like that. Yeah, it's amazing. Um, all right, that's the pod. That's the end of the play of hit is ball. Hope you guys enjoyed it.
